About TurboVNC
==============

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to
view and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote
computer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine
and send only the pixels generated by those applications to your local machine.
VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems
and architectures as both servers and clients.

TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains
a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image-
intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image
editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of
applications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete
solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.

All Platforms
=============

All versions of TurboVNC contain the following programs:

  vncviewer - the TurboVNC Viewer.  On Un*x platforms (except Mac), this is an
              X Windows application and requires an X Windows server.  On Mac
              platforms, it is a script that launches the Mac TurboVNC Viewer
              app, which is simply a packaged version of the Java TurboVNC
              Viewer and the libjpeg-turbo JNI library.

              vncviewer connects to a VNC server and allows you to interact
              with the remote desktop being displayed by the VNC server.


Windows-Specific
================

The Windows version of TurboVNC contains the following programs:

    putty - an open-source SSH client, which is bundled with vncviewer to
            simplify making secure connections to TurboVNC servers

The Windows version of TurboVNC should work with Windows 2000 and later.


Linux/Un*x-Specific (not Mac)
=============================

The Linux/Un*x version of TurboVNC contains the following programs:

  Xvnc - the TurboVNC Server.  Xvnc is both a VNC server and an X server with a
         "virtual" framebuffer.  You should normally use the vncserver script
         to start Xvnc.

  vncserver - a wrapper script that makes starting Xvnc more convenient.
              vncserver requires Perl.

  vncpasswd - a program that allows you to configure the access credentials for
              your TurboVNC server sessions.

  vncconnect - Normally, vncviewer connects to Xvnc, but you can use this
               program to initiate a "reverse connection", whereby Xvnc
               connects to an instance of vncviewer that has been started in
               "listen mode."

  tvncconfig - a helper program that runs in the VNC server session and
               handles the transfer of clipboard data between the TurboVNC
               Server and X applications.
