2005-10-03 22:51  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Improved the
	VncViewer.setEncodings() method. Now it does not build the complete
	encoding list when auto-selecting encodings.

2005-10-03 22:26  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Implemented encoding auto
	selection based on measuring current network throughput.

2005-10-03 20:25  const_k

	code. Also, now we request compression and quality levels
	regardless of current preferred encoding and color format.

2005-10-03 09:52  const_k

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncViewer.java: Now the encoding array is
	prepared in the VncViewer.setEncodings() method, instead of
	OptionsFrame.setEncodings(). This will allow to implement auto
	encoding selection in VncViewer.setEncodings().

2005-10-03 08:32  const_k

	* Makefile: Added JCFLAGS variable for javac command-line flags.

2005-09-30 19:42  const_k

	Measuring network throughput. This will allow auto encoding
	selection work properly.

2005-09-30 10:38  const_k

	* OptionsFrame.java: Starting implementation of automatic encoding
	selection. Right now, the "Auto" choice in the encoding list is
	equivalent to "Tight", but without an option to set the compression
	level.

2005-07-03 16:03  const_k

	* README: Version string changed for version 1.3dev7.

2005-07-03 15:57  const_k

	on opening the desktop.

2003-07-24 21:42  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Applied a set of changes by
	HorizonLive.com, Inc. In the VncCanvas class, fixed a problem of
	createImage() returning null. In the VncViewer, problems with some
	JVMs hanging on destroying the applet were solved. Also,
	implemented a possibility to enable/disable input via inter-applet
	communication.

2003-07-02 19:05  const_k

	* CapabilityInfo.java, CapsContainer.java, Makefile: Implemented a
	Java version of the CapsContainer class that will be used in the
	protocol 3.130 handling code.

2003-05-18 20:45  const_k

	* AuthPanel.java, VncViewer.java: Code refactored to enable
	integration of pluggable authentication schemes. Now the Java
	viewer first connects to the server, then shows the authentication
	panel only if the server requires authentication.  All the
	authentication code has been moved to the AuthPanel class.  Also,
	now the viewer shows status messages on connecting to the server.

2003-03-02 16:54  const_k

	* RfbProto.java: Passing through X keysyms for foreign currencies,
	a modified patch from Bernd Krueger-Knauber.

2002-11-12 15:15  const_k

	* index.html: Applet height increased by 32 pixels.

2002-11-12 13:34  const_k

	* Makefile: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having just
	index.vnc should be enough.

2002-11-12 13:33  const_k

	* hextile.vnc, index.html, index.vnc, noshared.vnc, shared.vnc,
	tight.vnc, zlib.vnc: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having
	just index.vnc should be enough. Also, an example HTML page has
	been prepared, to simplify installation under a standalone Web
	server.

2002-11-12 13:13  const_k

	* README: Documented three ways to use the Java viewer, in the

2002-10-30 00:26  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java: Don't defer update requests if there is some data
	to receive, or if the last update included a PointerPos message.

2002-10-29 23:06  const_k

	* HTTPConnectSocket.java, HTTPConnectSocketFactory.java, Makefile:
	Support for connections via HTTP proxies using HTTP CONNECT method.
	 Most likely, this will not work in applet mode, due to security
	restrictions in JVMs.

2002-10-29 23:03  const_k

	* OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Added support
	for new CursorPos pseudo-encoding which allows to transmit pointer
	position from server to clients.

2002-09-25 04:29  const_k

	* RecordingFrame.java: A patch from Harmen van der Wal -- "a
	workaround for AFAIK a rare (Blackdown 1.1.7)
	SecurityManager.checkPropertyAccess() bug, that would otherwise be
	fatal for an unprivileged applet".

2002-09-25 04:23  const_k

	* RfbProto.java, VncViewer.java: Enhancements to the exception
	handling mechanisms, a patch from Harmen van der Wal.

2002-09-25 04:01  const_k

	* Makefile, README, RfbProto.java, SocketFactory.java,
	VncViewer.java: A patch from Harmen van der Wal, which makes it
	easy to plug-in alternative transport methods to the viewer. It can
	be useful for for things like HTTP tunneling, SSL support, or
	perhaps for integration with "zebedee", ssh or other tunneling
	mechanisms.

2002-09-24 08:52  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java: Reducing max frame size by 30 pixels in each
	direction, to leave some place on the screen, e.g. for the menu bar
	on Macintosh or the task bar on Windows; a patch from Steve Kann.

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: More robust and
	correct methods to determine if Zlib- or Tight-encoded data should
	be saved Raw-encoded or re-compressed in recorded sessions. Also,
	always emit warnings in the Java console if such recoding was
	necessary.

2002-07-05 15:26  const

	* README: Minor documentation addition.

2002-07-05 13:17  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: JPEG quality setting should be enabled in the

2002-07-04 02:38  const

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Re-compressing Tight-encoded
	rectangles when recorded session starts after the connection was
	established, to make it possible to decompress the data without
	knowing prior pixel data.

2002-07-03 21:11  const

	* VncViewer.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Special handling
	of Zlib-encoded rectangles -- they are written either Zlib-encoded
	if it's a beginning of RFB session, or Raw encoded otherwise. This
	is needed to make sure it will be possible to decode saved data
	without knowing the state of zlib compression stream used by the
	encoder.

2002-07-03 17:49  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java: The
	"Record" button now appears only if current SecurityManager allows
	access to the local filesystem.  Exceptions after an intentional
	disconnect are not shown in the applet panel or window any more.

2002-07-03 16:40  const

	* RecordingFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java,
	VncViewer.java: Implement dynamic toggling of session recording.

	* RecordingFrame.java: Fixed copyright string.

2002-06-13 01:45  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java: A simple
	hack to make the RecordingFrame work, at least when the recording
	is being turned on before making the connection. The RecordingFrame
	is still not very useful but at least does allow to record a whole
	session in one file.

2002-06-12 19:03  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, Makefile, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java:
	Added new "Record" button and a GUI to control recording of
	sessions in FBS files.

2002-06-05 01:01  const

	* Makefile, OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, SessionRecorder.java,
	VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Implemented experimental feature to
	save RFB sessions in FBS files compatible with rfbproxy, and the
	new "Save Session" parameter where a user can set a file name.
	Color format requested from the server was changed to little-endian
	to make saved sessions similar to ones written by the VNC
	Reflector, and to make colors compatible with RFB Session Player.

2002-06-04 12:55  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Cleanups in "throws" statements.

	view-only mode using "R"/"r" keys.

2002-04-23 20:02  const

	* ButtonPanel.java: Bugfix: keyboard focus could be set
	incorrectly. It was returned to desktop even when windows such as
	Options or Clipboard were created.  This looked like new windows
	had appeared behind the authenticator or desktop window, if the
	viewer itself was running in a separate window.

2002-04-10 02:10  const

	* VncViewer.java: Minor bugfix to prevent the "Refresh" button to
	disappear after the "Disconnect" button changes to "Hide desktop".

2002-04-10 02:05  const

	* VncViewer.java: Previous bugfix was broken.

2002-04-10 02:01  const

	* VncViewer.java: Minor bugfix to prevent dumping exceptions on
	pressing "R"/"r" keys over disconnected desktop.

2002-04-10 01:53  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, OptionsFrame.java, README, RfbProto.java,
	VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Documented applet parameters,
	updated copyright strings.

2002-02-12 19:53  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Solved all issues with JPEG image loading.  Added
	more comments in the source code.

2002-02-12 18:13  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Solved problems with
	asynchronous JPEG image loading, although the solution is not ideal
	yet. Now the ImageObserver interface is used only to track loading
	of JPEG images, and is not used with drawImage() method calls. 
	Draft scaling implementation appeared in previous CVS commit was
	temporarily removed in this revision.

2002-02-08 18:06  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Simple and inefficient scaling
	implementation, new "Scaling Factor" parameter.

2002-02-08 00:20  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, VncViewer.java: Preventing authentication
	retries when the PASSWORD parameter is used.  Closing windows and
	disconnecting on the applet shutdown.  Terminating the application
	properly on closing the authentication window.	Packing the window
	on reporting errors when in a separate window; this is necessary
	because it's possible that the window was empty.  Disconnecting on
	fatal errors.  Always forcing the keyboard focus go to the desktop
	on activating the connection.  Code re-organizations and cleanups
	e.g. new tryAuthenticate() method.

2002-01-31 00:25  const

	* VncCanvas.java: The frame size now should be limited by the
	screen size.  JPEG support improved, but drawing is still not
	reliable.  Minor code cleanups -- methods re-arranged.

2002-01-31 00:22  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: A small piece of debugging code removed.

2002-01-30 19:47  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Drawing model
	was changed again; now usual off-screen Image is used for
	double-buffering instead of MemoryImageSource.	Preliminary
	implementation of JPEG support in the Tight decoder.  New "JPEG
	image quality" parameter and corresponding item in the Options
	frame.

2002-01-25 12:49  const

	broke 8-bit color mode.  Bugfixes in the XCursor encoding support:
	cursor colors were interpreted incorrectly.

2002-01-15 03:11  const

	* VncCanvas.java: 24-bit Tight decoder finished. Now it parses
	24-bit (not 32-bit!) color samples correctly, and is able to decode
	data pre-processed with the "Gradient" filter.

2002-01-15 00:46  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Preliminary working support for 24-bit colors in
	the Tight decoder.

2002-01-14 20:00  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: Color format was not set correctly.

2002-01-14 19:32  const

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Code cleanups: changes in
	rfb.is.read() and rfb.is.readFully() calls.

	* AuthPanel.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Support for
	24-bit color in RichCursor encoding.

2002-01-13 06:11  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Support for 24-bit colors. At
	this moment, all decoders support this color mode, with two
	exceptions of Tight and RichCursor.

2002-01-13 05:57  const

	* RfbProto.java: Removed a piece of code used for debugging.

2002-01-13 00:23  const

	to "Close".

2002-01-11 04:19  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, VncViewer.java: Changes in the button panel.
	Now keyboard focus moves back to the authentication panel or to the
	desktop after pressing any button on the panel. Additionally,
	keyboard focus should move to the desktop automatically when VNC
	connection is established.

2002-01-11 03:53  const

	* ButtonPanel.java: Implemented new "Refresh" button. Pressing it
	results sending a non-incremental FramebufferUpdateRequest message
	to the server.

2002-01-11 03:51  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Now the viewer adjusts its desktop/window size on
	desktop size changes on the remote side (working support for
	NewFBSize pseudo-encoding).

2002-01-11 02:50  const

	* AuthPanel.java, ButtonPanel.java, ClipboardFrame.java, Makefile,
	OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java,

	shared.vnc, tight.vnc, vncCanvas.java, vncviewer.java, zlib.vnc:
	New "Open New Window" parameter was implemented, now the viewer can
	work in a separate frame instead of running in the applet area. 
	Class names were capitalized, to reflect usual Java naming
	standards.

2002-01-11 00:22  const

	* hextile.vnc, index.vnc, noshared.vnc, shared.vnc, tight.vnc,
	zlib.vnc: Inserted a <br> tag to prevent www.tightvnc.com link

	Bell RFB message.

2001-12-16 21:33  const

	* vncCanvas.java: Drawing techniques have been changed: now all the
	painting is performed in update() and paint() methods of the Canvas
	component.  This should solve painting problems under some JVM
	implementations.

2001-12-16 20:56  const

	* Makefile, animatedMemoryImageSource.java, dir.mk, vncCanvas.java:
	First step of converting the source to Java 1.1: got rid of
	animatedMemoryImageSource class; using new setAnimated() method in
	the standard MemoryImageSource class instead.

2001-09-16 14:06  const

	* optionsFrame.java, rfbProto.java, vncCanvas.java, vncviewer.java:
	Addition of new parameters PASSWORD, "Include Controls", and "View
	Only", modified patch from Steve Kann.

2001-06-18 23:46  const

	* README: Version string change.

2001-05-12 16:55  const

	* vncviewer.java: (setEncodings): Possible NullPointerException
	fixed.

2001-03-07 14:06  const

	* vncCanvas.java: Initial "software cursor" position set to (0, 0)
	instead of (40, 40).  Minor code clean-up.

2001-02-16 04:45  const

	* vncCanvas.java: Minor performance fix and tiny clean-ups in code
	and comments.

2001-02-16 03:29  const

	* clipboardFrame.java, optionsFrame.java: Tiny changes after
	looking in the TridiaVNC CVS sources.

2001-02-16 02:48  const

	* README: Version string changed.

2001-02-15 23:48  const

	* vncCanvas.java: A number of performance optimizations and code
	clean-ups for all supported encodings.

2001-02-15 01:56  const

	* optionsFrame.java, vncCanvas.java: Drawing techniques changed:
	now all drawing is performed through the rawPixelsImage object and
	the pixels[] array, paintImage is not used any more.  Settings "Raw
	pixel drawing: Fast/Reliable" and "CopyRect: Fast/Reliable" removed
	from the Options panel since they do not make sense in new drawing
	model.	Currently drawing of solid-color areas is slow but this
	issue hopefully will be fixed in next versions.

2001-02-08 07:06  const

	* rfbProto.java, vncCanvas.java, vncviewer.java: Fixes for
	compilation on Java 2 platform, from Klaus Erber.

	all modes.

2001-01-26 01:31  const

	* optionsFrame.java, rfbProto.java, vncCanvas.java: Support for
	EncodingLastRect added.  Bugfix: "Cursor shape updates: Ignore"
	option caused exceptions on XCursor updates.

2001-01-26 01:10  const

	* optionsFrame.java, vncCanvas.java, vncviewer.java: RichCursor and
	XCursor encodings now work, but only for raw encoding.	Minor

	support, minor code cleanups.

2001-01-23 23:42  const

	* optionsFrame.java, rfbProto.java: "Cursor shape updates" item in
	options frame.	Minor bugfix: "Compression level" item remained
	enabled when raw encoding was chosen after zlib or tight.

2001-01-23 22:02  const

	* optionsFrame.java, rfbProto.java: Requesting compression level
	for tight and zlib encodings.
