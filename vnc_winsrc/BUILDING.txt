  TightVNC version 1.3.8
  BUILDING vncviewer and WinVNC

======================================================================

  Building from the source distribution
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source distribution is ready to compile, but the only compiler
supported is MS Visual C++ 6.0. Workspace files (*.dsw) for this
environment are included in the distribution.

Building with Borland C++ 5.5 compiler is not supported any more,
sorry.

  Building from the CVS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sources in the CVS do not include third-party libraries required
for successful compilation. These are zlib and JPEG libraries freely
available in the source form from the following locations:

  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz

Please download these libraries prior to compilation. Note that these
archives are in tar+gzip format not very popular in Windows
environments. To unpack the files, either install appropriate
extractors available for Windows platforms, or unpack them on
Unix-like machines.

After you have downloaded and unpacked the libraries, place their
source files to the locations listed below, NOT overriding existing
files:

  zlib library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/zlib/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/zlib/

  JPEG library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/libjpeg/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/libjpeg/

Also, TightVNC compilation requires Microsoft Html Help SDK which can
be freely downloaded from this page:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp

Only two files from the Html Help SDK are required for compilation,
HtmlHelp.h and HtmlHelp.lib. Copy both files to the following folders:

    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/

After zlib, JPEG and HtmlHelp files are in place, the source is ready
to compile with MS Visual C++ 6.0.
