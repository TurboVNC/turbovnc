	* winvnc/: vncMenu.cpp, vncProperties.cpp, vncProperties.h: In
	certain cases we do not want to remember or restore current tab
	selection in the Properties dialog. In particular, tab selection is

2006-08-05 13:19  const_k

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: Disabling mirror driver support under NT4
	completely. Driver support was broken under NT4, it detected the
	driver and "used" it even if it was not installed. Thus, updates
	were not detected properly.

2006-08-05 12:12  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h: Reverted changes to
	vncClient::m_inputblocked incremental semantics introduced in a

	-sharewindow but do not require arguments. These options do not
	start WinVNC - they control already running WinVNC instance
	instead.  These modification also introduce the -sharearea option,
	but it's not fully functional at the moment.

	vncProperties.cpp, vncProperties.h: Improved and simplified the
	SharedDesktopArea class, removed related stuff from the Properties

	incorrect.

2003-02-23 00:25  const_k

2003-02-06 05:00  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncAcceptDialog.cpp, vncClient.cpp: Major bugfix --
	handling of the QueryAllowNoPass option was seriously broken. In
	addition to solving this issue, this patch re-organizes and fixes
	the InitAuthenticate() function in several more ways. E.g. the
	order of checks is now different -- first it checks for disabled
	empty passwords and loopback connections, then it checks AuthHosts
	settings and shows the query dialog, and only after that it
	requests authentication if necessary. Now the InitAuthenticate()
	function is much more mature and its code is much more readable.

	vncServer.h, vncService.cpp, vncService.h: Integrated changes from
	standard VNC 3.3.3r9.

2001-08-05 16:45  const

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h,
	Flasher.cpp, History.txt: Integrated changes from standard VNC
	3.3.3r9.

2001-08-05 16:08  const

2001-07-30 01:05  const

	* BUILDING.txt, README.txt: Version strings changed.

2001-07-30 01:04  const

	* winvnc/: vncBuffer.cpp, vncBuffer.h, vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h,
	vncDesktop.cpp, vncDesktop.h, vncEncoder.cpp, vncEncoder.h,
	vncService.cpp: RichCursor encoding is now fully supported. Code
	implementing cursor shape updates has been reorganized, large parts
	were rewritten; this should be the final version of the "local
	cursor" feature. Besides that, code cleanups in many places.

2001-07-18 23:26  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bug fixed: vncviewer used
	to set cursor hotspot incorrectly on XCursor and RichCursor
	updates.

2001-03-13 18:52  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bugfix: local cursor
	implementation allocated DC and bitmap on each cursor movement but
	failed to free these recources. On Win95/98, after GDI resources
	were exhausted, mouse movement leaved cursor trails on the screen.
	Current fix allocates DC and bitmap only on cursor shape updates
	and disposes them properly.

2001-03-13 18:44  const

	* build-bcc32.bat, vncviewer/omnithread/build-bcc32.bat,
	vncviewer/res/build-bcc32.bat, winvnc/Makefile.bcc32,
	winvnc/WinVNC.rc, winvnc/VNCHooks/Makefile.bcc32,
	winvnc/omnithread/build-bcc32.bat: More porting to Borland C++ 5.5
	compiler. Now build scripts and makefiles should work in Win95/98
	environment.

2001-03-12 00:13  const

	* winvnc/: vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h: Started work to implement
	cursor shape updates for every possible cursor shape. At this
	moment, a skeleton for new implementation has been prepared, the
	code has been re-organized, but basic functionality has remained
	the same.

2001-03-12 00:05  const

	* vncviewer/Log.cpp, winvnc/Log.cpp: CORE SDI fixes applied to fix
	buffer overflows reported 2001-01-29.

2001-03-11 01:41  const

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: The color depth is set to correct value in
	24-bit truecolor mode.	Original WinVNC always used to set depth =
	bitsPerPixel. This change notably improves performance of the Tight
	encoder in both compression ratios and encoding/decoding speed.

2001-03-11 01:35  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: The "gradient" filter enabled again.

	Log.h, VNCOptions.cpp, VNCviewerApp.cpp, VNCviewerApp32.cpp,
	vncviewer.cpp, vncviewer.h: The name of global variable "log"
	changed to "vnclog".

2001-03-10 23:06  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Bugfix: "gradient" filter
	was broken in non-24-bit color depths.

2001-03-10 23:05  const

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Default preferred encoding is now
	Tight.

2001-03-10 23:05  const

	* vncviewer/res/vncviewer.rc: Two version info blocks merged into
	one record.

2001-03-08 00:30  const

	* winvnc/tabletranstemplate.cpp: Workaround for buggy Borland C++
	5.5 compiler: pixel format translations from 24-bit colors worked
	incorrectly when optimizations were enabled.

2001-03-07 14:03  const

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h,
	ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: "Local cursor" implementation now works
	with scaling.

2001-03-07 13:56  const

	* winvnc/: vncEncodeTight.cpp, vncEncodeTight.h: Changes from
	current Unix version ported to Win32 code.  Minor formatting
	changes and code clean-ups.

2001-03-06 01:00  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: JPEG encoder worked incorrectly in
	16bpp mode (bug found by Martin Granell).

2001-03-06 00:03  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Minor clean-ups and tiny
	formatting fix.

2001-03-05 23:39  const

	Proper cooperation between threads in "local cursor" code.  Correct
	loading of configuration files where "compresslevel" or "quality"
	setting were not set.  Corrected path to libjpeg library in the
	vncviewer.dsw.	Minor code clean-ups.

2001-03-03 23:13  const
