+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

* TightVNC 1.2.9

  - Win32 version: Major security-related bug in the server has been
    fixed -- handling of the "QueryAllowNoPass" option was seriously
    broken. Together with fixing this bug, the whole authentication
    logic in the server code has been redesigned.

  - Win32 version: Now the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive is being
    closed properly on restoring display settings, on disconnect. This
    change should solve the problem with unloading the registry on
    logout, when WinVNC is running as a service.

  - Win32 version: Problems with "QuerySetting" and "QueryTimeout"
    options have been fixed -- the settings could be copied from user
    configuration to default settings without user's intention.

  - Win32 version: A long-standing bug has been fixed -- the logic to
    handle retries after authentication failures was flawed, and used
    to delete the same object twice under certain conditions.

  - Win32 version: Now it's possible to specify port numbers with the
    winvnc -connect option, using the "host::port" format. Also,
    providing a -connect option without arguments now brings up the
    "Add New Client" dialog.

  - Unix version: New "Request refresh" button has been implemented in
    the viewer's F8 popup menu.

  - Unix version: Xvnc compilation fixes for HP-UX and MacOS X have
    been applied, from Ki NETWORKS, Inc.

  - Unix version: New vncpasswd -f command-line option has been
    implemented. It allows providing passwords on stdin and writes
    encrypted passwords to stdout. In addition, the password file name
    "-" now denotes stdout. Finally, a buffer overflow has been fixed
    in vncpasswd -- it could be caused by a long file name in the
    command line.

  - Unix version: A patch to fix input focus problems in the X11
    viewer has been applied, from Greg Breland.

  - Unix version: A patch fixing Xvnc crashes on Sparc has been
    applied, from the RealVNC distribution.

  - Unix version: A problem with incorrect port interpretation has
    been fixed, in the vncviewer's -tunnel option handling. Thanks to
    Clark Sessions.

  - Java viewer: A modification from Bernd Krueger-Knauber has been
    accepted, to pass through X keysyms for foreign currencies.

  - Java viewer: The problem with initial keyboard focus not set to
    the desktop on some JVMs has been fixed.

  - Other minor improvements and bugfixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.8

  - Unix and Win32 versions: Support for a separate view-only password
    has been implemented. Now the servers support two passwords -- one
    to allow full control, another to restrict remote keyboard and
    mouse input.

  - Win32 version: The password reset problem has been solved. In
    versions starting from 1.2.4, the password could get changed in
    the registry on opening Properties dialog and just hitting the OK
    button.

  - Win32 version: New "-reload" command-line option has been
    implemented in Win32 server. It forces the running instance to
    reload the registry settings.

  - Win32 version: "RemoveWallpaper" and "LockSetting" options have
    been made configurable in the Properties dialog; the code has been
    ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.

  - Win32 version: Support for "AllowEditClients" registry setting has
    been ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.

  - Unix version: New "-x11cursor" option has been implemented in
    vncviewer; a patch from Peter Astrand. This option allows using a
    real X11 cursor with X11-style cursor shape updates, disables the
    dot cursor, and disables cursor position updates in non-fullscreen
    mode.

  - Unix version: New "RunCommand" command to customize the X11
    vncviewer popup menu has been implemented; a patch from Peter
    Astrand.

  - Unix version: Several patches from Debian Linux have been applied.
    This should fix a number of bugs and improve building on some
    platforms supported by Debian Linux.

  - Unix version: A problem with Xvnc eating all CPU time after xfs
    restarts has been fixed; a patch from Martin Koegler.

  - Other minor improvements and bugfixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.7

  - Unix and Win32 versions, Java viewer: The most significant problem
    with local cursor handling has been solved -- now clients can see
    remote cursor movements performed on the server or by another
    client. New PointerPos encoding and cursor shape updates both
    minimize bandwidth requirements and greatly improve responsiveness
    of the mouse pointer, while still allow to track correct pointer
    position in all situations.

  - Unix and Win32 versions: In all the places where display numbers
    had to be used, now it's easy to use port numbers as well. The
    viewers now allow to use new "hostname::port" syntax, in addition
    to the traditional "hostname:display" format. The same new syntax
    can be used in the "Add new client" dialog of Win32 server. In the
    server, now it's equally easy to set display and port numbers. 
    Besides that, HTTP and RFB port numbers can be set individually.

  - Unix and Win32 versions: In servers, decreased JPEG quality
    factors for low quality levels. This improves bandwidth usage
    while the image quality remains satisfactory in most cases. In
    clients, JPEG compression is now enabled by default, because
    usually it's a reasonable choice. To prevent viewers from
    requesting JPEG compression, new -nojpeg option can be used.

  - Unix and Win32 versions: Improved installer under Windows, better
    RPMs for Linux.

  - Win32 version: Major enhancements in layout and functionality of
    the dialog boxes.

  - Win32 version: New keyboard handling code has been ported from
    RealVNC 3.3.6. This should solve all the issues with arrow keys
    acting as numbers in console windows, and shift+arrows not working
    under Win2k.

  - Win32 version: Adopted WinVNC -reinstall option from RealVNC
    3.3.5, together with a number of other changes in different
    places. The viewer now accepts a port number after the -listen
    command-line option, an improvement from RealVNC 3.3.6.

  - Win32 version: Eliminated high CPU usage on the server before
    sending cursor shape updates.

  - Unix version: Bugfix for Xvnc's -localhost and -interface options
    that were broken on many systems, thanks to Luke Mewburn for the
    bugfix. Xvnc -version command-line option is now supported.

  - Tight encoding is now documented in rfbproto.h files within source
    archives.

  - Java viewer: Implemented new buttons "Login again" and "Close
    window" near the disconnect or error messages in the applet mode,
    and introduced new "Offer Relogin" parameter to control this
    improvement. Thanks to Peter Astrand for the initial version of
    the "Login again" patch.

  - Java viewer: Support for connections via HTTP proxies using HTTP
    CONNECT method. This will not work in the applet mode, due to Java
    security restrictions.

  - Java viewer: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having just
    index.vnc should be enough. Also, an example HTML page has been
    prepared, to simplify installation under a standalone Web server.

  - Java viewer: Added a MANIFEST to the JAR archive, to allow easy
    execution of the JAR file, using java -jar command-line option.

  - Other minor improvements and bugfixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.6

  - Win32 version: In this version, when WinVNC binds to a local TCP
    port, it does not try to check several times if the port is in
    use. It just re-uses the port if the display number is not set to
    "Auto". One visible effect of this change is that the delay
    between starting up and showing the icon is greatly reduced.

  - Unix version: Fixed the bug which caused the vncserver script to
    fail when the XAUTHORITY environment variable was not set.

  - Unix version: Fixed the bug which prevented the vncpasswd utility
    from setting correct permissions on the passwd file.

  - Unix version: Fixed a repeated challenge replay attack
    vulnerability, bugtraq id 5296.

  - Unix version: Added files to simplify building of Linux RPMs,
    thanks to Peter Astrand.

  - Unix version: Improved scrolling in the full-screen mode, modified
    patch from Ville Herva.

  - Minor cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.5

  - Win32 version: Fixed a problem in the I/O subsystem that was
    introduced in TightVNC 1.2.2 and was causing major slowdown in
    communication with clients.

  - Win32 version: Enabled remote upgrade in the installation script. 
    Also, the installer will install a copy of the TightVNC Web site,
    and will create shortcuts to most important documentation pages.

  - Win32 version: Implemented new feature to specify applet
    parameters in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server. 
    Added support for new "EnableURLParams" registry setting which can
    be used to enable this feature.

  - Win32 version: Added support for the NewFBSize pseudo-encoding
    allowing to change framebuffer geometry on the fly on server's
    request.

  - Win32 version: Included "solution" and "project" files for MS
    Visual Studio 7, from Andrew van der Stock, applied a set of minor
    fixes to suppress compilation warnings under MS Visual Studio 7.

  - Win32 version: The viewer now tries to preserve the size and
    position of the desktop window after applying new connection
    options.

  - Unix version: Implemented new feature to specify applet parameters
    in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server. Added
    support for new $PARAMS variable in .vnc HTML templates.

  - Unix version: Added the possibility to keep users' vnc directories
    under /tmp, as suggested by Ivan Popov. This mode can be enabled
    by editing the $vncUserDir variable in the vncserver script. Also,
    new -t option has been implemented in the vncpasswd utility which
    allows to change VNC password files under /tmp.

  - Unix version: Applied Xvnc -viewonly patch from Ehud Karni.

  - Unix version: Applied Linux/PowerPC Xvnc fix from Peter A. Castro.

  - Unix version: Bug fixed: Xvnc failed to reset compression level
    and JPEG image quality on reading lists of encodings supported by
    clients.

  - Unix version: Made the viewer handle XCursor encoding operating on
    the framebuffer instead of setting new cursors directly in X.

  - Unix version: Applied a number of porting fixes from Ki Networks,
    Inc.

  - Java viewer: Added new feature allowing to save RFB sessions in
    FBS files compatible with rfbproxy. This feature works only if JVM
    security manager allows access to the local filesystem, which is
    usually true only when the viewer is used as a standalone
    application or if the viewer applet is cryptographically signed.
    New "Record" button will appear in the button panel if this
    feature is enabled.

  - Java viewer: Added new "ENCPASSWORD" parameter, modified patch
    from Peter Astrand.

  - Java viewer: Applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with
    Swedish keys and broken JVMs.

  - Other minor fixes and cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.4

  - Win32 version: WinVNC crashes on reporting zero statistics were
    fixed. This should eliminate crashes when using x2vnc and win2vnc
    client programs.

  - Win32 version: a problem with listening viewer was fixed.
    Initiating multiple non-shared connections could crash the viewer
    application.

  - Win32 version: real passwords are never placed into the password
    text control in the WinVNC Properties dialog any more. This should
    prevent grabbing plain-text passwords from that text control.

  - Win32 version: logging on errors was improved to provide better
    diagnosis for errors, especially for those causing the message
    "Connection closed" right after authentication.

  - Win32 version: handling of log files was improved. Now WinVNC
    should be able to save backup copies of log files under
    Win95/98/Me. Also, all log files are now written in MS-DOS/Windows
    text format instead of the Unix one.

  - Win32 version: a problem with reporting error messages in the
    listening viewer was fixed.

  - Win32 version: reporting incorrect statistics in the Tight encoder
    was fixed.

  - Win32 version: HTML pages and templates for the built-in HTTP
    server were improved.

  - Unix version: applied patch from Ki Networks, Inc. solving build
    problems on a number of commercial Unix systems, and fixing a
    number of minor bugs and typos.

  - Unix version: added a possibility to denote standard input with
    the "-" file name instead of a real password file name.

  - Unix version: fixed a bug causing vncpasswd utility work
    incorrectly when a file name argument was given in the command
    line.

  - Unix version: applied patch to solve keyboard focus problems in
    the full-screen vncviewer, from Peter Astrand. The patch does not
    seem to solve all the issues, but definitely makes things better.
    New grabKeyboard resource was added to control full-screen mode
    behavior.

  - Java viewer: new "Show Offline Desktop" parameter was added to
    make the desktop still visible even after the remote side has
    closed connection.

  - Java viewer: error messages were made much more meaningful.

  - Java viewer: keyboard focus problems were fixed. This should
    prevent opening new windows (e.g. Options or Clipboard) behind the
    active authenticator or desktop window.

  - Java viewer: now "R"/"r" keys can be used to request screen
    updates in view-only mode.

  - Java viewer: applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with
    Swedish keys and broken JVMs.

  - Other minor fixes and cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.3

  - Unix and Win32 versions: zlib library was updated to the most
    recent version (1.1.4) where a potential security issue was fixed.

  - Unix and Win32 versions: fixed blocking I/O problems in built-in
    HTTP servers. Older versions had to wait while one client finishes
    his transaction, only then they served new client connections,
    thus making easy denial-of-service attacks possible.

  - Unix and Win32 versions: updated built-in Java viewer, see details
    below.

  - Win32 version: Added support for mouse wheel events. Wheel mouse
    support is fully compatible and interoperable with Unix version
    where this feature was available for a long time.

  - Win32 version (WinVNC): The -connect command-line option now
    accepts a display number after a hostname.

  - Win32 version: Creating associations for .vnc files in the
    installer.

  - Java viewer was GREATLY improved: the code was converted to Java
    1.1, painting techniques were re-designed completely (now the
    viewer should work in MacOS), several new parameters were added,
    all parameters were documented in the README file. Most important
    new features include: support for 24-bit colors, JPEG support in
    Tight encoding, RFB Bell message support, new "Refresh" button, a
    possibility to operate in a separate scrollable window, dynamic
    view-only mode. Many more changes were introduces, see the
    ChangeLog for more information. Please note that new Java viewer
    class names were changed, e.g. vncviewer.jar file has become
    VncViewer.jar etc.

  - Unix version: a number of changes in the vncserver script, e.g.
    the default color depth is now 24, extra delay after Xvnc startup
    removed, font path is now configurable in the beginning of the
    script, and more.

  - Unix version: zlib library was removed from the core X sources.
    Instead, both vncviewer and Xvnc now can use either system zlib
    and JPEG libraries, or ones packaged within TightVNC source
    archive in the lib/ directory. Unix sources are distributed in two
    versions: one with these libraries for those who don't have them
    installed in the system, and another version without libraries,
    copied directly from CVS, for those who do have zlib and/or JPEG
    libraries installed. In the former case, build procedure would
    include additional "make libs" step. System libraries will be
    linked dynamically, libraries included in the source archive will
    be linked in statically.

  - Unix version now includes comprehensive manual pages for
    vncviewer, vncserver, Xvnc, vncconnect and vncpasswd programs. The
    vncinstall script in the source distribution now accepts one more
    parameter allowing to specify where to install manual pages.

  - Unix version (Xvnc): a number of patches from Red Hat Linux vnc
    package were incorporated into the TightVNC codebase. This adds
    support for more architectures including s390 and s390x, adds a
    possibility to use tcp_wrappers for Xvnc access control.

  - Unix version (Xvnc): several bugfixes, e.g. applied patch to fix
    crash in the code dealing with font server; fixed word alignment
    problem in raw encoder experienced by Sparc users.

  - Unix version is no more distributed as patches to a standard VNC
    release. This is because patches cannot handle changes in binary
    files and handle file removals very inefficiently.

  - Other minor fixes and cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.2

  - Win32 server: long-standing Win9x resource consumption problem has
    been fixed. Now the server thread does not use blocking I/O, and
    therefore is always ready to process messages from the VNCHooks
    DLL.

  - Win32 server: now built-in HTTP daemon may be enabled and disabled
    interactively from the Advanced Preferences dialog (this setting
    is saved in new "EnableHTTPDaemon" registry key).

  - Win32 server: changes in layout and text of the Advanced
    Preferences dialog.

  - Xvnc: Minor bugfix which should prevent potential dereference of a
    NULL pointer.

  - Unix viewer: Now viewer window would be raised on beep (bell)
    event, unless new -noraiseonbeep option is provided in the command
    line or "raiseOnBeep" resource set to False.

  - One more packaging option for the Unix source: ready to build
    archive with Zlib and JPEG libraries inside.

  - Other minor fixes and cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.1

  - Win32 server: added support for reverse connections on ports other
    than 5500, modified patch from Steve Kann.

  - Win32 viewer: added support for new command-line options:
    -noshared and -encoding XXX.

  - Bugfixes in Win32 viewer: changes in exception handling eliminate
    Borland C++ compilation problems causing application crashes on
    repetitive connections, notably in the listen mode. Also, now
    warning exceptions causing disconnects are reported to user,
    except for the case when a user has closed the viewer window.

  - Better packaging in Win32 version: self-installing package is
    available, vncviewer now shows correct icon image.

  - Unix vncviewer: Default tunneling command template has been
    changed, to allow tunneled connections to hosts where only
    loopback VNC connections are enabled. New -via <GATEWAY>
    command-line option provides enhanced tunneling functionality, now
    one can make vncviewer tunnel connections to a VNC host via third
    machine acting as a gateway.

  - Java viewer: Addition of new parameters PASSWORD, "Show Controls",
    and "View Only", modified patch from Steve Kann.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TightVNC 1.2.0

  - Tight encoding is now configurable and can operate at different
    compression levels where low compression levels are very fast in
    terms of CPU usage. New "-compresslevel N" option implemented in
    vncviewer to set compression levels for Tight encoding (1 - fast,
    9 - best).

  - Enhanced techniques to split large rectangles in Tight encoder;
    now it tries to find large solid-color areas and send them in
    separate rectangles.

  - Lossy JPEG compression in Tight encoding has been implemented, new
    "-quality N" vncviewer option should be used to enable this
    feature (0 - low image quality and best compression, 9 - best
    image quality). JPEG compression is used only for screen areas
    that seem to be suitable for JPEG compression (although algorithms
    to detect such areas are not perfect, of course).

  - New "XCursor" and "RichCursor" encodings implemented. They are
    used to transmit cursor shape updates from server to clients
    ("local cursor" feature requested by many users). Mouse movement
    no longer causes framebuffer updates to happen, vncviewer
    processes mouse locally when this feature is active. New
    -nocursorshape vncviewer option turns this feature off.

  - A number of recent changes from both TridiaVNC and AT&T's releases
    merged into the source, now the code is based on version 3.3.3r2
    for Unix part, and on 3.3.3r9 for Win32.

  - Unix vncviewer: When -tunnel option is specified in the command
    line, special rules are now used to choose preferred encoding. Now
    viewer does not think that server is running on the same machine
    when tunneling is on and the preferred encoding is now "tight"
    with default compression instead of raw.

  - Xvnc: Rules to set default pixel formats have been changed: now
    they are RGB565 instead of BGR556 for color depth 16, and RGB888
    instead of BGR888 for depth 24. This makes Xvnc compatible with
    Imlib renderer used in Gnome and also helps to avoid unnecessary
    pixel format translations in many cases.

  - Xvnc: X11 modifier mapped to META key is now Mod4 instead of Mod1.
    New -compatiblekbd option implemented in Xvnc to force META and
    ALT keys behave the same way as they do in the original AT&T's
    version.

  - A number of bugs fixed: viewer crashes after inflate() call, Xvnc
    CoRRE encoding problems, Xvnc bit-order issues in XCursor and
    RichCursor encodings, etc.

  - Java viewer now supports Tight encoding and cursor shape updates.
    Drawing techniques were changed, settings "Raw pixel drawing:
    Fast/Reliable" and "CopyRect: Fast/Reliable" removed from the
    Options panel since they do not make sense in new drawing model.

  - Other new features, optimizations, fixes and cleanups, see
    ChangeLog files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* VNC Tight Encoding 1.1

  - New ``gradient'' filter implemented in servers (it can be disabled
    in Xvnc with new -lazytight option). The filter preprocess
    full-color screen areas prior to compression in order to achieve
    better compression ratios (with the cost of slower compression).
    Vncviewers of version 1.0 had support for this filter already, but
    there was small bug causing image distortions in certain cases. So
    it is recommended to upgrade both servers and viewers.

  - Stupid bug fixed: extra unused color was included in palettes in
    many cases; compression ratios used to be worse than they should
    be.

  - The algorithm used to split large rectangles into parts has been
    changed. This change can increase compression ratios in many
    situations.

  - Byte-order issues in servers have been (hopefully) fixed.

  - Performance tuning, code rewrites and cleanups in various places.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* VNC Tight Encoding 1.0

  - Initial release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
