If you're upgrading TightVNC remotely, working in an active VNC session, please
read and understand the following:

 * Remote upgrade requires rebooting the computer. If you want to be able to
   access your computer after the reboot, make sure you're running WinVNC
   as a service, not in the application mode.

 * If you're running WinVNC service from some another VNC distribution, this
   installation procedure won't replace it with the TightVNC service by default. 
   This is a limitation that may be solved in future versions. However, there is
   a way to perform such an upgrade: install TightVNC into the same directory
   where old VNC files (WinVNC.exe and VNCHooks.dll) are installed. In this
   case, old binaries will be replaced by the new ones during the reboot, and
   there will be no need to re-install the service. Please note that the installer
   should show you the reboot prompt at the end of the installation, otherwise
   you probably selected wrong installation directory.

 * There is a number of things that can prevent the machine to reboot correctly,
   and that can cause losing the control over the computer. In other words, there
   is NO WARRANTY that the remote upgrade procedure is absolutely reliable.
   To minimize possible risks, close all the running applications (besides the
   WinVNC service itself) before launching the TightVNC installer.
