TightVNC compilation notes for Borland C++ 5.5 users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to perform two steps in order to build the project with Borland C++
5.5 "free" compiler:

1. Make sure the compiler is installed correctly.

   You have to put path to Borland C++ binaries to your PATH environment
   variable (this path is "C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin" by default) and to prepare
   correct configuration files for compiler and linker. Please read the
   document available at

     http://www.objectcentral.com/vide/help/videdoc/bcc32.html

   for more details on correct Borland C++ 5.5 installation. Here are
   example configuration files that were used to build TightVNC for Windows
   95/98 and Windows NT 4.0:

   C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin\bcc32.cfg: =========================================

     -I"c:\Borland\Bcc55\include"
     -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib;c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib\psdk"
     -DWINVER=0x0400
     -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0400

   C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin\ilink32.cfg: =======================================

     -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib;c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib\psdk"

   =========================================================================

2. Run build-bcc32.bat from the top-level directory ("vnc_winsrc").

   This command file will try to build TightVNC (both server and viewer
   parts) using Borland C++ 5.x command-line tools. It will create the
   "binaries" sub-directory and copy three files there: vncviewer.exe and
   two files WinVNC server consist of: winvnc.exe and VNCHooks.dll.
