## Configuration of the TurboVNC Server.
##
## This file uses Perl syntax, although only one-line assignments
## are allowed.  Assignments can be applied to the following variables:
##
##  $geometry    -- desktop geometry, WIDTHxHEIGHT or
##                  W0xH0+X0+Y0[,W1xH1+X1+Y1,...,WnxHn+Xn+Yn]
##  $depth       -- color depth in bits per pixel (between 8 and 32)
##  $desktopName -- X desktop name
##  $vncClasses  -- directory containing the Java VNC viewer classes
##  $vncUserDir  -- path to TurboVNC user directory (session information,
##                  VNC passwords, and log files are stored here)
##  $fontPath    -- X font path
##  $securityTypes -- comma-separated list of security types to enable
##                    (passed to Xvnc in the -securitytypes argument)
##  $generateOTP -- 1 to generate an initial one-time password.  (OTP
##                  authentication must be enabled and permitted)
##  $autoLosslessRefresh -- automatic lossless refresh timeout (in seconds,
##                          or 0 to disable)
##  $enableHTTP  -- 1 to enable the embedded web server (which serves up the
##                  Java TurboVNC Viewer) or 0 to disable
##  $wm          -- the window manager startup script to use (for instance,
##                  "mate-session" or "2d")
##  $useVGL      -- 1 to run the window manager startup script using VirtualGL
##  $autokill    -- 1 to automatically kill the TurboVNC session when the
##                  startup script finishes or 0 to leave it running
##  $pamSession  -- 1 to create a new PAM session for each viewer that
##                  authenticates using the username/password of the user who
##                  owns the TurboVNC session, and leave the PAM session open
##                  until the viewer disconnects
##  $multiThread -- 0 to disable multithreaded encoding
##  $numThreads  -- number of threads to use with multithreaded encoding
##                  (0 = use the server's default thread count)
##  $passwdFile  -- path to VNC password file to use with VNC Password
##                  authentication
##  $x509CertFile -- path to X.509 signed certificate file (in PEM format) to
##                   use with X.509 encryption
##  $x509KeyFile -- path to X.509 private key file (in PEM format) to use with
##                  X.509 encryption
##  $serverArgs  -- additional arguments to pass to Xvnc (refer to the Xvnc man
##                  page for a list of accepted arguments)
##  $maxClients  -- Set the maximum number of clients allowed to connect to the 
##                  server.  Acceptable values are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048

## Uncomment this to use the X font server by default, rather than a static
## font path.
#
# $fontPath = "unix/:7100";

## Here is another example of setting the font path:
#
# $fontPath = "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
# $fontPath = "$fontPath,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/";

## You might wish to create the TurboVNC user directories under /tmp, to
## ensure that VNC passwords are always kept on the local filesystem.  To do
## that, uncomment the line below.  Note that in this case, Xvnc will search
## for the .Xauthority file in this same directory by default, and the TurboVNC
## startup script will be stored in $ENV{HOME}/.turbovncstartup instead of in
## $vncUserDir/xstartup.turbovnc.
#
# $vncUserDir = "/tmp/$ENV{USER}-vnc";

## These settings are the default.  Uncomment and edit to change.
#
# $passwdFile = "$vncUserDir/passwd";
# $x509CertFile = "$vncUserDir/x509_cert.pem";
# $x509KeyFile = "$vncUserDir/x509_private.pem";
