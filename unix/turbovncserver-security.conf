# this host.  If a user attempts to start a session with a larger geometry than
# this or to use remote desktop resizing to increase the desktop size to a size
# larger than this, the desktop size will be clamped to this width/height.

# This specifies the maximum idle timeout (in seconds) for all TurboVNC
# sessions started on this host.  The idle timeout is the amount of time that
# a TurboVNC session can remain idle (with no VNC viewer connections) before it
# will automatically exit.  If this value is set to a number greater than 0,
# then all TurboVNC sessions on this host will use this idle timeout value by
# default, and the user will only be allowed to override it with a lower value.
