.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvncserver\fR is a wrapper script for \fBXvnc\fR, the VNC (Virtual Network
Computing) X server. Xvnc provides all of the capabilities of a standard X
server, but it does not connect to a physical display. Instead, \fBXvnc\fR
creates a virtual X display that you can view or control remotely using a VNC
viewer.
.SH OPTIONS
You can add \fBXvnc\fR options to the \fBvncserver\fR command line. They will be
passed through to Xvnc without modification. The options provided by
\fBvncserver\fR itself are as follows:
.TP
\fB:\fR\fIdisplay\fR
The X display number that Xvnc should occupy. If omitted, the next free display number
is used.
.TP
\fB\-geometry\fR \fIwidth\fR\fBx\fR\fIheight\fR
Set width and height of the virtual X display.
.TP
\fB\-geometry\fR \fIW0\fRx\fIH0\fR+\fIX0\fR+\fIY0\fR[,\fIW1\fRx\fIH1\fR+\fIX1\fR+\fIY1\fR,...,\fIWn\fRx\fIHn\fR+\fIXn\fR+\fIYn\fR]
Set multi-screen geometry of the virtual X display.  Wi and Hi are the width
and height of Screen i, and Xi and Yi specify the offset of Screen i relative
to the origin.  The total width and height are determined by the bounding box
of all screens.
.TP
\fB\-depth\fR \fIdepth\fR
Set the color depth of the virtual X display, in bits per pixel. Must
be a value between 8 and 32.
.TP
\fB\-pixelformat\fR \fBrgb\fR\fINNN\fR|\fBbgr\fR\fINNN\fR
Specify the pixel format of the virtual X display. Xvnc can use any pixel
format you choose, but if this pixel format does not match the pixel format
of the display on which vncviewer is running, then Xvnc will perform pixel
format conversion prior to sending images to vncviewer. This can slow
performance. The default pixel format, rgb888, is equivalent to BGRA on little
endian systems or ARGB on big endian systems.  A pixel format of bgr888 is
equivalent to RGBA on little endian systems or ABGR on big endian systems.
.TP
\fB\-fp\fR \fIfont-path\fR
The vncserver script will normally examine your system to figure out where it
stores its X11 fonts and then generate an appropriate font path for Xvnc based
on this.  If your system stores its X11 fonts in a location that vncserver does
not know about, however, then this may fail.  In that case, vncserver will then
try to contact the local X Font Server (xfs) on port 7100.  Not all systems
have xfs installed and running, so this may fail as well.  In that case, you
can manually specify a font path by using the -fp argument to vncserver.

If you prefer to use the X Font Server by default rather than a static font
path, then you can run

{TurboVNC_directory}/bin/vncserver -fp unix/:7100

on Linux systems or

{TurboVNC_directory}/bin/vncserver -fp inet/:7100

on Solaris systems.
.TP
\fB\-name\fR \fIstring\fR
This specifies the name of the desktop.
.TP
\fB\-nohttpd
The default behavior of the \fBvncserver\fR script is to enable the embedded
web server in Xvnc, which serves up the Java TurboVNC Viewer on a dedicated
port.  Passing an argument of -nohttpd to \fBvncserver\fR tells it not to enable
the embedded web server in Xvnc.
.TP
\fB\-otp\fR
If the One-Time Password authentication method is enabled and permitted in
Xvnc, then this generates an initial one-time password and prints it to the
console prior to starting Xvnc.
.TP
\fB\-x509cert\fR \fIcert\fR
Specify the X.509 signed certificate file (in PEM format) to use with X.509
encryption.  If this argument is specified, then it is passed to Xvnc.
Otherwise, the \fBvncserver\fR script passes a default value of
$vncUserDir/x509_cert.pem to Xvnc.
.TP
\fB\-x509key\fR \fIkey\fR
Specify the X.509 private key file (in PEM format) to use with X.509
encryption.  If this argument is specified, then it is passed to Xvnc.
Otherwise, the \fBvncserver\fR script passes a default value of
$vncUserDir/x509_private.pem to Xvnc.
.TP
\fB\-fg\fR
Runs Xvnc as a foreground process.  This has two effects: (1) The TurboVNC
session can be aborted with CTRL-C, and (2) the TurboVNC session will exit as
soon as the user logs out of the window manager in the session.  This may be
necessary when launching TurboVNC from within certain grid computing
environments.
.TP
\fB\-autokill\fR
Automatically kill the TurboVNC session when the startup script exits (which,
in most cases, means that the session will be killed automatically whenever the
user logs out of the window manager running in the session.)
.TP
\fB\-noxstartup\fR
Do not run the $vncUserDir/.vnc/xstartup.turbovnc script after launching Xvnc.
This option allows you to manually start a window manager in your TurboVNC
session or to run a full-screen application without a window manager.
.TP
\fB\-xstartup\fR \fIscript\fR
Run a custom startup script, instead of xstartup.turbovnc, after launching
Xvnc.  This is useful in conjunction with the \fB-fg\fR option, since it
allows for running a full-screen application (such as a game or a
virtualization solution) in TurboVNC without a window manager and causes the
TurboVNC session to terminate whenever the application exits.
.TP
\fB-wm\fR \fIscript\fR
This sets the value of the \fBTVNC_WM\fR environment variable to \fIscript\fR.
The default xstartup.turbovnc script that \fBvncserver\fR creates will launch
the window manager startup script specified in the \fBTVNC_WM\fR environment
variable, if it is set.
.TP
\fB\-vgl\fR
This sets an environment variable (\fBTVNC_VGL\fR) to 1, and the default
xstartup.turbovnc script that \fBvncserver\fR creates will launch the window
manager using VirtualGL if that environment variable is set.  More
specifically, if \fBTVNC_VGL\fR is set, then the xstartup.turbovnc script will
launch the window manager using a command specified in another environment
variable (\fBTVNC_VGLRUN\fR.)  The default value of \fBTVNC_VGLRUN\fR is
"vglrun +wm", but users can override that environment variable in order to pass
additional arguments to vglrun, to specify the full path of vglrun, or to use
another command to launch the window manager.
.TP
\fB\-log\fR  \fIfile\fR
Redirect the output of Xvnc to \fIfile\fR, rather than to
$vncUserDir/.vnc/{hostname}{display}.log.
.TP
\fB\-kill\fR \fB:\fR\fIdisplay\fR
Stops the VNC session that is currently running on the specified display.
.TP
\fB\-list\fR
Lists the display numbers and process ID's of all VNC sessions that are
currently running under your account on this host.
.TP
\fB\-help\fR
Prints a brief list of command line options
.SH EXAMPLES
