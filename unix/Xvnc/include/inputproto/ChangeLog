    specs: rename EVENTMASK to EVTYPEMASK
    
    EVENTMASK was used twice in the spec, once as the actual bitmask for events,
    once as the set of deviceid, mask length and mask.
    
    The libXi public API uses XIEventMask for the latter data triplet, so leave
    EVENTMASK, and rename the pure bitmask to EVTYPEMASK.

    The smart thing would be to have the SD's keyboard focus to be identical to

    Unbreak protocol ABI for XIAllowEvents - inputproto 2.1.99.6
    
    XIAllowEvents was extended with touchid and grab_window in
    2ea2f99f4fe1dcd3b8e539ca41c482fc40a0533d. This extended the size of
    the request from 12 to 20 but also broke the ABI. Older server
    match the request size exactly, so compiling libXi 1.5 against
    inputproto 2.2 and then running it against a pre-XI 2.2 server causes a
    BadLength for any XIAllowEvent request.
    
    Add a new request for the new data.

    specs: explain touch behaviour for dependent devices
    
    Dependent devices don't send touch events until the interaction is a true
    touch interaction (i.e. doesn't just serve to move the pointer). Once that
    happens, all touchpoints send touch events exclusively. Pointer movement
    restarts once we're down to one touch that controls the pointer again.
    
    For clients listening to touch events in addition to pointer events, this
    also means that a two-finger tap looks identical to holding one finger down
    and tapping with a second-finger. Both actions will result in short
    TouchBegin/TouchEnd sequences for both fingers.
    
    The above is the default behaviour we expect from touchpads, the protocol is
    more generically worded to leave more room for drivers to decide when a
    touch only controls the pointer and when it doesn't.

    Set a flag on the pointer-emulating touch event
    
    Toolkits need to know which touch event emulated a pointer event and which
    ones do not. To quote Carlos Garnacho:
    
        GTK+ does client-side windows by default (GdkWindows without a backing X
        window), for this to work the toplevel window in the client needs to
        select for more events that it wouldn't normally select for in order to
        cater for the event masks in such child "windows". This means that
        ideally GTK+ should set the touch events mask in the toplevel, and then
        find out whether the "window" would receive pointer or touch events for
        the sequence emulating the pointer, and perform the emulation itself.

    Allow grabbing clients to accept or reject touches any time
    
    This is potentially both a performance and client complexity
    improvement. An example is a gesture recognizer using touch grabs on
    each window with a subscription. If events on a child window are known
    to not match any subscription on the child window, then the client
    should be able to reject the touch grab even if the parent window hasn't
    accepted any of the touches, perhaps because the parent window
    gesture hasn't timed out or crossed other thresholds yet.
    
    As an inverse example, the events may match a child window subscription
    before the root window has rejected ownership. The child window should
    be able to accept the touch proactively. This allows for further clients
    to receive a TouchEnd event earlier, and means the client may be able to
    reduce state being tracked. If this were not allowed, the client would
    need to wait until it received ownership before accepting the sequence.

    Move scroll information into a new class.
    
    Using labels only to mark smooth scrolling axes disallows scrolling from
    hardware events (e.g. a mouse wheel). If those axes are marked as scrolling
    axes instead, the clients lose information which hardware axis this event
    corresponds to.
    
    For example, on Wacom devices, the client can benefit from smooth scrolling
    on the strip or wheel event but may still require the knowledge whether the
    axis is a vertical strip (e.g. Intuos3) or a absolute scrolling wheel (e.g.
    Intuos4).
    
    Thus, add a new class to XIQueryDevice that represents scrolling information
    on a valuator. One of these ScrollClass may exist for each ValuatorClass if
    that valuator is a scrolling valuator. The increment field of this class
    removes the requirement for 1.0 == 1 unit of scrolling.
    
    This isn't true in most cases, especially where physical scroll axes are
    involved. Wacom Intuos4 scroll rings have a unit size of 3.0 and the driver
    historically sent one scroll event per 3.0 increment or decrement. Mapping
    one scroll event to 1.0 makes the ring mostly unusable through legacy
    button events.

    Two new axes are added to support smooth scrolling: Rel Vert Scroll and

    RawEvents in XI2 do not provide the source ID. The libXi headers however do

    This has no effect on the wire size of the struct, we can re-use a pad byte

    XI2.1: send RawEvents at all times.
    
    When a client grabbed a device, XI 2.0 only sends RawEvents to that client.
    This behaviour is problematic and cannot be worked around for many
    applications that need to continue receiving events.
    
    On the other hand, no client seems to rely on this behaviour or use it to
    its advantage. For XI 2.1, disable this behaviour and continue to send raw
    events regardless of the grab state of the device.

    Fix up pointer event emulation section
    
    * Wording cleanups for tense and to make some sentences flow better.
    * Upon further review, it does seem to make more sense to deliver
      emulated pointer events through the same slave device rather than the
      master device. Thus, slave devices (including floating devices) may
      emit emulated pointer events.
    * Peter is correct, it doesn't make sense to set the PointerEmulated
      flag on touch events.

    Add XI2-specific defines for grab and property requests
    
    XI 2.0 headers forced clients to mix XI2 specific constants with defines for
    core input. Most notable here are the grab code which required GrabModeAsync
    or GrabModeSync from core, but _not_ AnyModifier (XIAnymodifier !=
    AnyModifier). This is a hard-to-debug cause for bugs.
    
    Add defines for grab modes, grab return codes and property modes as well as
    a define for the AnyPropertyType. These defines are identical to the ones
    defined in core but stop the use of input-related defines from either core
    or XI 1.x.
    
    Clients must use the core defines None and CurrentTime where applicable.

    Though this protocol description is mainly to be viewed as textfile, a few
    minor changes make it parsable for asciidoc to spit out reasonably
    nicely-formatted html code.
    
    Changes include:
    - underline section headers with the matching lines
    - add linebreaks before lists to parse them as lists
    - change indentation level for normal text to be left-marging aligned and
      for <pre> text to be indented
    - comment out section dividers
    
    It's possible to run asciidoc XI2proto.txt and get some nice html output
    now.

    Define the error cases for XSetDeviceMode better.
    
    Take the error codes as described in the man page for XSetDeviceMode. This
    is more likely to be what clients expect, especially since the protocol spec
    doesn't actually define when BadMode is to be reported.
    
    This behaviour is the same as specified in the XSetDeviceMode man page.

    Revert "XI2proto.txt: grabbing a slave does not detach it anymore."
    
    Detaching a slave device during an explicit grab makes sense from a UI
    perspective. It allows a client to get exclusive access to a device without
    that device's events also feeding into the respective master device.
    
    Thanks to Thomas Jaeger for his contribution.

    Instead of a single XI_RawEvent type with subtypes to represent the actual

    Include button state in XIButtonClasses.
    
    Without including the state in a button class, it is impossible to know the
    state of a device until this device has pressed or released another button
    (and thus sends an event).

    Add a source field to the class information.
    
    In some cases it is required to know the source device of a particular
    device class. In the future we might also do lazy copying of classes,
    meaning that for a given device, each class may come from a different
    source. Hence the source id should be included for each class.

    xXIHierarchyEvent should list num_info, not num_devices.
    
    The structures following the request are referred to as "info", having a
    name of "num_devices" is misleading as the number of info structs does not
    always reflect the number of devices (e.g. if a device got removed).

    Define the Cursor datasize correctly
    
    On 64 bit machines, without Cursor defined Xlib would allocate 64 bits
    rather than 32 to any structs using Cursor. This led to data not
    correctly being available on the wire hence the Xserver would do strange
    things. We hence define Cursor to what it should be and make sure
    we undefine it after we've finished to users of XIproto.h aren't affected

    XI2: remove button state from the RawEvent.
    
    A RawEvent is supposed to represent the state posted by the device. If a
    client needs button state, then the client must keep track of it.

    deviceid, which is (aside from time) the only thing it has in common with

    Add major/minor version as supported by client to GetExtensionVersionReq.
    
    This sort-of breaks old clients. Behaviour to be assumed is that if nbytes is
    0, major/minorVersion is set and specifies the version as supported by the
    client.
    If nbytes is non-zero, the request is trailed by the extension name (INAME)
    and major/minorVersion is undefined. This is the behaviour of pre-MPX clients.
    
    And then there may be clients who found that no other extension uses this
    request and supplying a name wasn't actually necessary since it was XI anyway.
    These clients will break. Tough luck. Read the man pages next time.

    C sucks: define XEventClass in terms of unsigned int, not CARD32.
    
    Apparently pulling in Xmd.h here breaks qt, since they both define an

    ILP32 because whoever wrote Xmd.h is a C novice).
