    Xge: remove warning messages about missing Xge extension event translations
    
    When mixing Xlib and xcb, it's quite possible for some events to be
    received for xcb-only extensions, which will subsequently not be
    translatable by the Xge WireToEvent/EventToWire hooks

    XeviGetVisualInfo: Free & clear *evi_return, not evi_return pointer
    
    evi_return is passed in as a pointer to a location into which
    XeviGetVisualInfo is expected to write a pointer to the memory
    it allocated for the returned structures.  If we're failing and
    bailing out, we need to dispose of the pointer we set, not the
    one passed into us (which the caller may have put on the stack
    or allocated as part of a larger structure).
    
    Flagged by cppcheck 1.64:
    [lib/libXext/src/XEVI.c:182] -> [lib/libXext/src/XEVI.c:186]:
     (warning) Possible null pointer dereference: evi_return - otherwise it
               is redundant to check it against null.

    A malicious X server claiming to not support GE but sending a GE would
    SEGV the client  (always a NULL derefrence).  Possible since d1c93500.

    Remove fallback for _XEatDataWords, require libX11 1.6 for it
    
    _XEatDataWords was orignally introduced with the May 2013 security
    patches, and in order to ease the process of delivering those,
    fallback versions of _XEatDataWords were included in the X extension
    library patches so they could be applied to older versions that didn't
    have libX11 1.6 yet.   Now that we're past that hurdle, we can drop
    the fallbacks and just require libX11 1.6 for building new versions
    of the extension libraries.

    docbook.am: embed css styles inside the HTML HEAD element
    
    Rather than referring to the external xorg.css stylesheet, embed the content
    of the file in the html output produced. This is accomplished by using
    version 1.10 of xorg-xhtml.xsl.
    
    This makes the whole html docs tree much more relocatable.
    In addition, it eliminates xorg.css as a runtime file which makes
    xorg-sgml-doctools a build time only package.

    Adding support in libX11 for html chunking caused a reorg of docbook.am

    The parameter img.src.path is added for pdf images.
    A searchpath to the root builddir is added for local entities, if present.
    
    The docbook.am makefile hides all the details and is identical for
    all 22 modules having DocBook documentation. It is included by a thin
    Makefile.am which requires no docbook knowledge.

    Install target dbs alongside generated documents
    
    This matches a change in xorg-sgml-docs whereby the masterdb will look for
    the target dbs into the same location as the generated documents.
    
    The target dbs are now installed alongside the generated documents.
    Previously they are installed in $prefix/sgml/X11/dbs alongside masterdb which
    has the potential of installing outside the package prefix and cause
    distcheck to fail when user does not have write permission in this package.
    
    Requires XORG_CHECK_SGML_DOCTOOLS(1.8) which was released 2011-06-11

    Correct XShm return values.
    
    XShmAttach, XShmDetach, XShmPutImage do not return a Status but 0 or 1.
    Though the man section for XShmAttach says "if all goes well, you will get a
    non-zero status, back" this is counter to the usage of Status in Xlib
    itself where 0 means Success and no-zero specifies the specific error.
    
    XShmPixmapFormat does not return a Status but the pixmap format or 0 on
    failure.

    Documentation: add Docbook external references support
    
    When writing technical documentation, it is often necessary to cross
    reference to other information. When that other information is not in the
    current document, additional support is needed, namely <olink>.
    
    A new feature with version 1.7 of xorg-sgml-doctools adds references to
    other documents within or outside this package.
    
    This patch adds technical support for this feature but does not change
    the content of the documentation as seen by the end user.
    
    Each book or article must generate a database containing the href
    of sections that can be referred to from another document. This database
    is installed in DATAROOTDIR/sgml/X11/dbs. There is a requirement that
    the value of DATAROOTDIR for xorg-sgml-doctools and for the package
    documentation is the same. This forms a virtual document tree.
    
    This database is consulted by other documents while they are being generated
    in order to fulfill the missing information for linking.
    Refer to the xorg-sgml-doctools for further technical information.

    Initial Fence Sync Object support
    
    Allows creating and managing binary state sync
    objects.  Currently they aren't useful because
    there is not yet a way to wait for them or
    query their state.  X fence objects are owned
    by a screen.  As Aaron Plattner pointed out,
    screens are identified by a drawable in X
    protocol, so XSyncCreateFence() takes a drawable
    to identify which screen to create the fence on.

    Don't smash the event_vec if num_events differs between lib and server.
    
    If the library extension thinks there's more events to an extension than the
    server actually has, the event_vec for the overlapping range can get
    overwritten. This depends on the initialization order of the libraries.

    Old servers (1.6 and before) included the extension library headers
    instead of using separate server header files. This patch makes the

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
