.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBXvnc\fR is a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server for Unix and Linux
systems.  It acts like a normal X server, except that it sends its output
to a virtual rather than a physical display.  Remote machines can connect
to the VNC server and see/control the output of this virtual display
[see \fBvncviewer\fR(1).]  Xvnc is built using the X.org source code and shares
many options with it.

Normally, you don't need to start Xvnc manually-- use the
\fBvncserver\fR(1) wrapper script instead.  This script sets reasonable
defaults for the TurboVNC session, checks many error conditions, etc.

Please read the SECURITY CONCERNS section if you plan to use VNC on an
untrusted network.
.SH OPTIONS
Xvnc supports many standard X server options and a number of
VNC-specific options.  To see which standard X server options are
supported, please look at the output of \fBXvnc\fR \fI\-help\fR and read
the \fBXserver\fR(1) manual page.  Some command-line options have equivalent
"Xvnc parameters" that can be configured dynamically using the
\fBtvncconfig\fP(1) program.

The VNC-specific options are as follows:

.TP
\fBTURBOVNC CONNECTION OPTIONS\fR

.TP
\fB\-alwaysshared\fR
Always treat new connections as shared.  Never disconnect existing users
or deny new connections when a new user tries to connect to a TurboVNC session
that is already occupied.

.TP
\fB\-capture\fR \fIfile\fR
Specify a file to which to capture the data sent to the first connected viewer.

.TP
\fB\-deferupdate\fR \fItime\fR
Amount of time, in milliseconds, for which to defer screen updates [default:
40].  Deferring updates helps to coalesce many small desktop changes into a few
larger updates, thus saving network bandwidth.

.TP
\fB\-desktop\fR \fIname\fR
Set VNC desktop name [default: "x11"].

.TP
\fB\-disconnect\fR
Disconnect existing viewers when a new non-shared connection is established,
rather than refusing the new connection.

.TP
\fB\-idletimeout\fR \fItime\fR
Amount of time, in seconds, that the TurboVNC session can sit idle (with no VNC
viewer connections) before it automatically exits [default: no timeout].  This
argument has no effect if the \fImax-idle-timeout\fR directive is specified in
the security configuration file and if that value is lower than
\fItime\fR.

.TP
\fB\-inetd\fR
If Xvnc is launched by inetd, this option causes Xvnc to redirect
network input/output to stdin/stdout.

.TP
\fB\-interface\fR \fIip-address\fR
Listen only on the network interface with the specified IP address.

.TP
\fB\-ipv6\fR
Enable IPv6 support.  If your system supports IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, then
this option causes Xvnc to accept both local and remote connections from both
IPv4 and IPv6 clients.  Otherwise, only connections from IPv6 clients will be
accepted.  If \fB-localhost\fR is also specified, or if the
\fIno-remote-connections\fR directive is specified in the security
configuration file, then this option causes Xvnc to accept only local
connections from IPv6 clients (the equivalent of specifying
\fB-interface ::1\fR.)

.TP
\fB\-localhost\fR
Only allow loopback connections from localhost.  This option is useful
in conjunction with SSH tunneling.  This option can be set for all TurboVNC
sessions on this system by using the \fIno-remote-connections\fR directive in
the security configuration file.  See the SECURITY CONFIGURATION
FILE section for more details.  Unless \fB-ipv6\fR is also specified, only
IPv4 loopback connections are accepted.

.TP
\fB-maxclipboard\fR \fIbytes\fR
Set the maximum clipboard transfer size to \fIbytes\fR [default: 1048576].

.TP
\fB-maxconnections\fR \fIconnection-count\fR
Allow no more than \fIconnection-count\fR simultaneous VNC viewer connections,
where 1 <= \fIconnection-count\fR <= 500 [default: 100].

.TP
\fB\-nevershared\fR
Never treat new connections as shared.  Do not allow simultaneous user
connections to the same TurboVNC session.

.TP
\fB-noclipboardrecv\fR
Disable inbound clipboard synchronization.  This prevents the clipboard of
the TurboVNC session from being synchronized with the clipboard of a connected
viewer whenever the latter changes.  This option can be set for all
TurboVNC sessions on this system by using the \fIno-clipboard-recv\fR
directive in the security configuration file.  See the SECURITY
CONFIGURATION FILE section for more details.

.TP
\fB-noclipboardsend\fR
Disable outbound clipboard synchronization.  This prevents the clipboard of
any connected viewers from being synchronized with the clipboard of the
TurboVNC session whenever the latter changes.  This option can be set for all
TurboVNC sessions on this system by using the \fIno-clipboard-send\fR
directive in the security configuration file.  See the SECURITY
CONFIGURATION FILE section for more details.

.TP
\fB\-noflowcontrol\fR
Normally, the TurboVNC Server will use the RFB flow control extensions
(Continuous Updates and Fence) with any connected viewers that support them.
These extensions allow the server to send framebuffer updates at the maximum
rate that the network connection and the viewer can handle, instead of waiting
for viewers to explicitly request updates.  Disabling flow control causes the
TurboVNC Server to send framebuffer updates at the maximum rate that the
network connection can handle, irrespective of the viewer.  For full-screen
video and 3D applications, this may produce smoother animation on high-latency
networks, although it will almost certainly also produce a noticeable lag
between mouse movement and application response, since the TCP buffers will be
100% full.

.TP
\fB\-noprimarysync\fR
X servers typically have two clipboard mechanisms: the PRIMARY selection, which
typically allows selected text to be pasted with the middle mouse button, and
the CLIPBOARD selection, which typically allows selected text to be
cut/copied/pasted using hotkeys or menu options.  The default behavior of the
TurboVNC Server is to synchronize either selection with the clipboard of any
connected viewers.  Specifying \fB-noprimarysync\fR prevents the TurboVNC
Server from synchronizing the PRIMARY selection, thus requiring the use of
hotkeys or menu options in order to transfer the clipboard between the TurboVNC
session and connected viewers.

.TP
\fB\-noreverse\fR
Do not allow reverse VNC connections to be made from this TurboVNC session.
This option can be set for all TurboVNC sessions on this system by using the
\fIno-reverse-connections\fR directive in the security configuration
file.  See the SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE section for more details.

.TP
\fB\-rfbport\fR \fIport\fR
TCP port that the server should use when listening for connections from normal
VNC viewers.

.TP
\fB\-rfbunixpath\fR \fIpath\fR
Specifies the path of a Unix domain socket on which Xvnc listens for
connections from viewers.  Specifying this option will disable listening for
TCP connections.

.TP
\fB\-rfbunixmode\fR \fImode\fR
Specifies the mode of the Unix domain socket.  The value has to be specified as
an octal number.  The default is 0600.

.TP
\fB\-rfbwait\fR \fItime\fR
Maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for a send/receive operation to/from a
connected viewer to complete [default: 20000].

.TP
\fBTURBOVNC INPUT OPTIONS\fR

.TP
\fB\-compatiblekbd\fR
Set META and ALT keys to the same X modifier flag, as in the original
version of Xvnc by AT&T labs.

.TP
\fB\-nocursor\fR
Don't display a mouse pointer on the remote desktop.

.TP
\fB\-viewonly\fR
Don't accept keyboard and pointer events from viewers.  All viewers will
be able to see the desktop but won't be able to control it.

.TP
\fB\-virtualtablet\fR
TurboVNC can handle extended input devices in one of two ways:

\fBRemote\ X\ Input\ Mode\fR (default)

X Input devices are created in the TurboVNC session only when a viewer requests
their creation.  For instance, the TurboVNC Un*x/Linux Viewer sends information
about client-side X Input extended pointer devices to the server, and the
server makes copies of those devices.  The viewer then sends extended input
events from the client-side devices to the server, where they are mapped to the
respective copies of the client-side devices.  If another viewer attempts to
create a remote X Input device with the same name, then the existing
server-side device is shared with the new viewer.  The server-side devices are
deleted automatically when all viewers that use them have disconnected.  This
is the most flexible way of handling extended input devices.

\fBVirtual\ Tablet\ Mode\fR (enabled with this command-line option)

In Virtual Tablet Mode, the TurboVNC Server creates virtual stylus, eraser,
touch, and pad devices designed to emulate a Wacom tablet, and it maps all
extended input events from all viewers to these devices (events from
client-side stylus, eraser, touch, and pad devices are mapped to the
corresponding virtual device in the TurboVNC session, and other events are
ignored.)  This mode is less flexible than Remote X Input Mode, since it relies
on Wacom-specific driver behavior that may change in the future.  Virtual
Tablet mode is useful when running specific applications from the X startup
script, rather than a window manager.  Because applications usually check for
the presence of X Input devices at startup, by the time the first viewer
connects and requests that the client-side devices be cloned, it is too late.

.TP
\fBTURBOVNC DISPLAY OPTIONS\fR

.TP
\fB\-geometry\fR \fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR
Set width and height of the virtual X display (single-screen.)

.TP
\fB\-geometry\fR \fIW0\fRx\fIH0\fR+\fIX0\fR+\fIY0\fR[,\fIW1\fRx\fIH1\fR+\fIX1\fR+\fIY1\fR,...,\fIWn\fRx\fIHn\fR+\fIXn\fR+\fIYn\fR]
Set multi-screen geometry of the virtual X display.  Wi and Hi are the width
and height of Screen i, and Xi and Yi specify the offset of Screen i relative
to the origin.  The framebuffer width and height are determined by the bounding
box of all screens.

.TP
\fB\-pixelformat\fR rgb\fINNN\fR|bgr\fINNN\fR
Specify the pixel format of the virtual X display.  Xvnc can use any pixel
format you choose, but if this pixel format does not match the pixel format
of the display on which vncviewer is running, then Xvnc will perform pixel
format conversion prior to sending images to vncviewer.  This can slow
performance.  The default pixel format, rgb888, is equivalent to BGRA on little
endian systems or ARGB on big endian systems.  A pixel format of bgr888 is
equivalent to RGBA on little endian systems or ABGR on big endian systems.

.TP
\fBTURBOVNC ENCODING OPTIONS\fR

.TP
\fB\-alr\fR \fItime\fR
Enable the automatic lossless refresh (ALR) feature for this TurboVNC session
and set the timeout to \fItime\fR seconds.  If ALR is enabled and no
framebuffer updates have been sent to a given viewer in the past \fItime\fR
seconds, and if "eligible" areas of the screen have been transmitted to that
viewer using JPEG since the last lossless refresh, then those areas of the
screen are re-transmitted using mathematically lossless image compression
(specifically, the Lossless Tight + Zlib encoding method.)

The default behavior is to only allow regions drawn using X[Shm]PutImage() or
CopyRect to be eligible for ALR.  The intent of this behavior is to restrict
ALR mainly to the pixels drawn by VirtualGL, but it also prevents blinking
cursors (which are usually drawn using XCopyArea()) from confusing the ALR
algorithm.  You can, however, set the \fBTVNC_ALRALL\fR environment variable to
\fB1\fR to make all screen regions eligible for ALR.  You can also set
\fBTVNC_ALRCOPYRECT\fR to \fB0\fR to make screen regions drawn with CopyRect
ineligible for ALR (approximating the behavior of TurboVNC 1.2.1 and prior.)

.TP
\fB\-alrqual\fR \fIlevel\fR
Instead of sending a mathematically lossless image for an automatic lossless
refresh, send a JPEG image with the specified JPEG quality (95 is a good
choice, as this is the equivalent of the "Tight + Perceptually Lossless JPEG"
preset.)

.TP
\fB\-alrsamp\fR 1X|2X|4X|gray
Specify the level of chrominance subsampling to be used when sending an
automatic lossless refresh [default: 1X].  This has no effect unless
\fB-alrqual\fR is also specified.

.TP
\fB\-economictranslate\fR
Use less memory-hungry pixel format translation if the TurboVNC session has a
16-bit-per-pixel framebuffer (\fB\-depth\fR \fI16\fR.)

.TP
\fB\-interframe\fR
Normally, the TurboVNC Server will enable interframe comparison whenever
Compression Level 5 or above is requested (if using Tight encoding, compression
levels 5-7 are equivalent to compression levels 0-2 with interframe comparison
enabled.)  Specifying \fB-interframe\fR will enable interframe comparison all
the time, regardless of the compression level that was requested by the viewer.
Interframe comparison maintains a copy of the remote framebuffer for each
connected viewer and compares each framebuffer update with the copy to ensure
that redundant updates are not sent to the viewer.  This prevents unnecessary
network traffic if an ill-behaved application draws the same thing over and
over again, but interframe comparison also causes the TurboVNC Server to use
more CPU time and much more memory, and thus it is recommended that this
feature be used only when needed.

.TP
\fB\-nointerframe\fR
Specifying this option will disable interframe comparison, regardless of the
compression level that was requested by the viewer.

.TP
\fB\-nomt\fR
Disable multithreaded Tight encoding

.TP
\fB\-nthreads\fR \fIthread-count\fR
Specify the number of threads to use with multithreaded Tight encoding.  The
default is to use one thread per CPU core, up to a maximum of 4 (because using
more than 4 encoding threads breaks compatibility with viewers other than the
TurboVNC Viewer.)  The server will not allow the thread count to exceed 8, nor
to exceed the number of CPU cores.

.TP
\fBTURBOVNC SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS\fR

.TP
\fB\-maxauthfails\fR \fIfail-count\fR
Specify the number of consecutive VNC password or OTP authentication failures
allowed from a client's IP address before connections from that IP address are
temporarily blocked [default: 5].  0 = no limit.

.TP
\fB\-authfailtimeout\fR \fItime\fR
Specify the initial length of time, in seconds, during which connections are
blocked from the IP address of a client that has exceeded the maximum number of
consecutive VNC password or OTP authentication failures [default: 10].  This
timeout period automatically doubles with each subsequent consecutive VNC
password or OTP authentication failure.

.TP
\fB\-pamsession\fR
Create a new PAM session for each viewer that authenticates using the
username/password of the user who owns the TurboVNC session, and leave the PAM
session open until the viewer disconnects.  When using Kerberos, this causes
pam_krb5 to create a Kerberos ticket for the TurboVNC session, which can be
reused within the session to provide access to other services.

This option can be disabled for all TurboVNC sessions on this system by using
the \fIno-pam-sessions\fR directive in the security configuration file.  See
the SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE section for more details.

.TP
\fB\-rfbauth\fR \fIpasswd-file\fR
Specify the password file to use with VNC Password authentication.
\fIpasswd-file\fR can be created using the \fBvncpasswd\fR(1) utility.  This
argument has no effect if \fIpermitted-security-types\fR is specified in the
security configuration file and none of the *VNC security types are listed as
permitted security types.

.TP
\fB-securitytypes\fR \fItype-list\fR
\fItype-list\fR is a comma-separated list of security types that should be
enabled for this TurboVNC session.  Refer to the SECURITY EXTENSIONS section
below for a description of available security types.  Only security types that
are permitted in the security configuration file will actually be enabled.  If
\fItype-list\fR contains no permitted security types, then Xvnc will exit with
an error.  If this argument is not specified, then Xvnc uses a default value of
"TLSVnc, TLSOtp, TLSPlain, X509Vnc, X509Otp, X509Plain, VNC, OTP, UnixLogin,
Plain".  Security types are case-insensitive.

.TP
\fB\-x509cert\fR \fIcert\fR
Specify the X.509 signed certificate file (in PEM format) to use with X.509
encryption (if X.509 security types are enabled and permitted) or the built-in
WebSocket proxy.

.TP
\fB\-x509key\fR \fIkey\fR
Specify the X.509 private key file (in PEM format) to use with X.509
encryption (if X.509 security types are enabled and permitted) or the built-in
WebSocket proxy.

.SH SECURITY EXTENSIONS
The TurboVNC Server supports 13 security types, each of which specifies an
authentication scheme (a technique used to transmit authentication credentials
from a VNC viewer to the VNC server), an authentication method (a technique
used by the VNC server to validate the authentication credentials), and an
encryption method.

The authentication methods that the TurboVNC Server supports are as follows:

.IP \fBNone\fR
No authentication.  Xvnc will not enable any security types that use this
authentication method unless no other security types are enabled.  This
authentication method should generally only be used in conjunction with SSH or
another security mechanism that provides authentication outside of the
context of Xvnc.

.IP \fBVNC\ Password\fR
Authenticate using a VNC password file created by the \fBvncpasswd\fR(1)
utility and specified with the \fB-rfbauth\fR command-line argument to Xvnc.
This authentication method uses the Standard VNC authentication scheme to
receive authentication credentials from a VNC viewer.  The Standard VNC
authentication scheme encrypts the VNC password using 56-bit DES, which is a
weak form of encryption.

.IP \fBOne-Time\ Password\ (OTP)\fR
Authenticate using a one-time password.  OTPs for full control or view-only
access can be created using the \fBvncpasswd\fR(1) utility.  OTPs are discarded
by Xvnc immediately after they are used, so an additional OTP must be generated
before another user is allowed to connect using this method.  OTP
authentication is handy for sharing a TurboVNC session with another person with
whom you do not wish to share your VNC password.  This authentication method
uses the Standard VNC authentication scheme to receive authentication
credentials from a VNC viewer.

.IP \fBPAM\ User/Password\fR
Authenticate using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM.)  This authentication
method is typically used to authenticate against Unix login credentials, but it
can also be used to authenticate against any other user/password authentication
credentials that can be accessed through PAM.  A valid PAM service
configuration must be created by the system administrator (see the SECURITY
CONFIGURATION FILE section for details.)  On some systems, it may be
necessary to make the Xvnc binary setuid root in order to authenticate against
credentials other than those of the user running Xvnc.

PAM User/Password authentication uses the TightVNC Unix Login or the VeNCrypt
Plain authentication scheme to receive authentication credentials from a VNC
viewer.  Since both of those authentication schemes transmit the password using
plain text, it is strongly recommended that TLS or SSH encryption be enforced
in the security configuration file if any security types using PAM
User/Password authentication are permitted.
.P

The security types that the TurboVNC Server supports are as follows:

.IP \fBNone\fR
No encryption and no authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the
"None" RFB security type or the "Tight" RFB security type with the "None"
authentication capability.

.IP \fBTLSNone\fR
Anonymous TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption with no authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "TLSNone" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBX509None\fR
TLS encryption with a specified X.509 certificate and no authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "X509None" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBVNC\fR
VNC Password/Standard VNC authentication with no encryption.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VNC" RFB
security type or the "Tight" RFB security type with the "VNC" authentication
capability.

.IP \fBTLSVnc\fR
Anonymous TLS encryption with VNC Password/Standard VNC authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "TLSVnc" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBX509Vnc\fR
TLS encryption with a specified X.509 certificate and VNC password/Standard VNC
authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "X509Vnc" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBOTP\fR
One-Time Password authentication with no encryption.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VNC" RFB
security type or the "Tight" RFB security type with the "VNC" authentication
capability.

.IP \fBTLSOtp\fR
Anonymous TLS encryption with One-Time Password/Standard VNC authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "TLSVnc" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBX509Otp\fR
TLS encryption with a specified X.509 certificate and One-Time
Password/Standard VNC authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "X509Vnc" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBPlain\fR
PAM User/Password / Plain authentication with no encryption.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type and the "Plain" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBTLSPlain\fR
Anonymous TLS encryption with PAM User/Password / Plain authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "TLSPlain" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBX509Plain\fR
TLS encryption with a specified X.509 certificate and PAM User/Password / Plain
authentication.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "VeNCrypt"
RFB security type with the "X509Plain" VeNCrypt sub-type.

.IP \fBUnixLogin\fR
PAM User/Password / Unix Login authentication with no encryption.

This security type can be used with VNC viewers that understand the "Tight" RFB
security type with the "Unix Login" authentication capability.
.P

The security type that will be selected when a VNC viewer connects depends on
the following:
.TP
\fBXvnc command-line options\fR
The \fB-securitytypes\fR argument allows you to request that specific security
types be enabled in Xvnc.
.TP
\fBThe \fIpermitted-security-types\fB directive\fR
If the security configuration file exists, then the system administrator
can use the \fIpermitted-security-types\fR directive in that file to specify
the security types that are allowed on the system.  A security type must both
be requested, by way of the \fB-securitytypes\fR argument (or in the default
security types that Xvnc uses if that argument is not specified), and permitted
in order for the security type to be enabled.  If none of the security types
meet this criteria, then Xvnc exits with an error.  For instance, if "TLSVnc"
is the only permitted security type, then it is an error to start Xvnc with
\fB-securitytypes X509Vnc\fR.

The \fIpermitted-security-types\fR directive also allows you to specify the
order in which authentication schemes are advertised to VNC viewers.  For
instance, if "UnixLogin" is listed first, then the TurboVNC Viewer will
default to using Unix Login authentication when connecting to any TurboVNC
sessions on this host.  Similarly, if "VNC" or "OTP" is listed first, then the
TurboVNC Viewer will default to using Standard VNC authentication.

If the security configuration file does not exist or
\fIpermitted-security-types\fR is not specified, then Xvnc behaves as if
\fIpermitted-security-types\fR was set to "TLSVnc, TLSOtp, TLSPlain, TLSNone,
X509Vnc, X509Otp, X509Plain, X509None, VNC, OTP, UnixLogin, Plain, None".
.TP
\fBThe negotiated RFB protocol version\fR
This is determined by the VNC viewer's capabilities.  Older VNC viewers that
support RFB version 3.3 can only use the "None", "VNC", or "OTP" security
types.  Newer viewers that support RFB 3.7 or later with the Tight RFB security
extension can use the "UnixLogin" security type, if the viewer has implemented
it.  Viewers that support RFB 3.7 or later with the VeNCrypt RFB security
extension can use the "TLS*", "X509*", and "Plain" security types, if the
viewer has implemented them.

Authentication will fail if a viewer that does not support or enable any of the
TurboVNC Server's permitted security types attempts to connect.
.TP
\fBThe VNC viewer user interface\fR
The VNC viewer's user interface may place additional restrictions on which
security types can be used.  For example, the TurboVNC Viewer has
command-line options that allow you to force the use of the VNC or Unix
Login authentication schemes, regardless of which scheme the server advertises
as the default.
.P
You can examine the Xvnc log file to see details of authentication
processing, including the authentication methods, RFB protocol versions,
and security types that have been enabled.
.SH SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
At startup, Xvnc reads security configuration information from
\fB@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_SYSCONFDIR@/turbovncserver-security.conf\fR.  For
security reasons, this pathname is hard-coded into the Xvnc executable and
cannot be changed without rebuilding Xvnc.  If present, the security
configuration file must be owned by either root or by the user who started the
TurboVNC session, and the file may not be writable by others.

Comment lines start with a hash (#) character.  Spaces and tabs are
ignored on lines containing configuration directives.  The configuration
directives are:

.IP \fIenable-user-acl\fR
If the "PAM User/Password" authentication method is used, then this directive
enables an internal user access control list (ACL) in all TurboVNC sessions
started on this host, to further limit which users will be permitted to attempt
PAM authentication.  Users can be added to or removed from this list using the
\fBvncpasswd\fR(1) utility.  The user who started the TurboVNC session will
automatically be added to the session's access control list.

.IP \fImax-desktop-size\fR=\fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR
This specifies the maximum desktop size for all TurboVNC sessions started on
this host.  If a user attempts to start a session with a larger geometry than
this or to use remote desktop resizing to increase the desktop size to a size
larger than this, the desktop size will be clamped to \fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR.

.IP \fImax-idle-timeout\fR=\fItime\fR
This specifies the maximum idle timeout (in seconds) for all TurboVNC sessions
started on this host.  The idle timeout is the amount of time that a TurboVNC
session can remain idle (with no VNC viewer connections) before Xvnc
automatically exits.  If this value is set to a number greater than 0, then all
TurboVNC sessions on this host will use this idle timeout value by default, and
the user will only be allowed to override it with a lower value.

.IP \fIno-clipboard-recv\fR
This prevents any TurboVNC sessions started on this host from receiving
clipboard changes from their connected viewers.

.IP \fIno-clipboard-send\fR
This prevents any TurboVNC sessions started on this host from sending clipboard
changes to their connected viewers.

.IP \fIno-pam-sessions\fR
Do not allow PAM sessions to be created for any TurboVNC sessions started on
this host.

.IP \fIno-remote-connections\fR
Do not allow inbound remote connections to be made to any TurboVNC session
started on this host.  Only connections from localhost can be made, which
effectively forces the use of SSH tunneling to make inbound remote connections.

.IP \fIno-remote-resize\fR
Do not allow remote desktop resizing with any TurboVNC session started on this
host.

.IP \fIno-reverse-connections\fR
Do not allow reverse connections to be made from any TurboVNC session started
on this host.  This causes Xvnc to ignore requests from the \fBvncconnect\fR(1)
utility.

.IP \fIno-x11-tcp-connections\fR
Do not allow X11 TCP connections to any TurboVNC session started on this host.

.IP \fIpam-service-name\fR=\fIsvcname\fR
Sets the service name to be used when Xvnc performs PAM authentication.  The
default service name is \fIturbovnc\fR.  This typically corresponds to a file
in \fB/etc/pam.d\fR or to a token in \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR.  For instance, if
your system has a file named \fB/etc/pam.d/passwd\fR, then copying this file to
\fB/etc/pam.d/{svcname}\fR would cause the username and password sent by the
VNC viewer to be validated against \fB/etc/passwd\fR.

.IP \fIpermitted-cipher-suites\fR=\fIsuite\fR[:\fIsuite\fR[...]]
Defines the set of permitted TLS cipher suites for the TLS* and X509* security
types.  Multiple colon-separated cipher suites may be specified.  (Run
\fBopenssl ciphers aNULL\fR for a list of available cipher suites for the TLS*
security types, and \fBopenssl ciphers\fR for a list of available cipher suites
for the X509* security types.)  The order in which these cipher suites are
specified defines the order in which Xvnc will advertise the cipher suites to
the VNC viewer.  This directive is ignored if the TurboVNC Server was built
with GnuTLS rather than OpenSSL.

.IP \fIpermitted-security-types\fR=\fItype\fR[,\fItype\fR[...]]
Defines the initial set of permitted security types.  Multiple comma-separated
types may be specified.  Accepted values for \fItype\fR are:
\fITLSVnc\fR, \fITLSOtp\fR, \fITLSPlain\fR, \fITLSNone\fR, \fIX509Vnc\fR,
\fIX509Otp\fR, \fIX509Plain\fR, \fIX509None\fR, \fIVNC\fR, \fIOTP\fR,
\fIUnixLogin\fR, \fIPlain\fR, and \fINone\fR.  Security types are
case-insensitive.  The order in which these types are specified defines the
order in which Xvnc will advertise the corresponding RFB security types and
authentication schemes to the VNC viewer.  This ordering may affect which
security type the VNC viewer chooses as its default.

.IP \fItls-key-length\fR
This specifies the length of the key, in bits, that the TurboVNC Server will
generate for any of the TLS* (anonymous TLS) security types.

.SH SECURITY CONCERNS
.P
Even when used with encryption, there are other security problems inherent in
the design of VNC.  Thus, it is recommended that you restrict network access to
TurboVNC sessions from untrusted network addresses.  Probably the best way to
secure a TurboVNC session is to allow only loopback connections from the host
(using the \fB\-localhost\fR option or the \fIno-remote-connections\fR security
configuration file directive) and to use SSH tunneling for remote access
to the TurboVNC session.  For details on using TurboVNC with SSH tunneling, see
the TurboVNC User's Guide.
.P
It is incumbent upon the system administrator to ensure that a security type
meets the security requirements for a particular site before it is permitted to
be used.  In particular, caution should be exercised when using security types
that support the Unix Login and Plain authentication schemes.  Unless SSH
tunneling or another suitable encryption mechanism is enforced, then the use of
these authentication schemes will result in Unix passwords being sent
unencrypted over the network.

.SH AUTHORS
VNC was originally developed at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.  TightVNC
additions were implemented by Constantin Kaplinsky.  TurboVNC, based originally
on TightVNC, is provided by The VirtualGL Project.  Many other people
participated in development, testing and support.
