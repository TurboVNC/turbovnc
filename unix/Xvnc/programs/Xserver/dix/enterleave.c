/**
 * @file
 * This file describes the model for sending core enter/leave events and
 * focus in/out in the case of multiple pointers/keyboard foci.
 *
 * Since we can't send more than one Enter or Leave/Focus in or out event per
 * window to a core client without confusing it, this is a rather complicated
 * approach.
 *
 * For a full description of the enter/leave model from a window's
 * perspective, see
 * http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-August/037606.html
 *
 * For a full description of the focus in/out model from a window's
 * perspective, see
 * http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-December/041740.html
 *
 * Additional notes:
 * - The core protocol spec says that "In a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the
 * event window contains the initial position of the pointer, then the child
 * component is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None.  For an EnterNotify
 * event, if a child of the event window contains the final pointer position,
 * then the child component is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None."
 *
 * By inference, this means that only NotifyVirtual or NotifyNonlinearVirtual
 * events may have a subwindow set to other than None.
 *
 * - NotifyPointer events may be sent if the focus changes from window A to
 * B. The assumption used in this model is that NotifyPointer events are only
 * sent for the pointer paired with the keyboard that is involved in the focus
 * events. For example, if F(W) changes because of keyboard 2, then
 * NotifyPointer events are only sent for pointer 2.

       F(W) moves from a descendant to W. detail is changed to Inferior.
