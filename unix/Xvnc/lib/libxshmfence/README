libxshmfence - Shared memory 'SyncFence' synchronization primitive

This library offers a CPU-based synchronization primitive compatible
with the X SyncFence objects that can be shared between processes
using file descriptor passing.

There are two underlying implementations:

 1) On Linux, the library uses futexes

 2) On other systems, the library uses posix mutexes and condition
    variables.

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
