Once upon a midnight hour, long ago, in a galaxy, far, far, away, Xlib
was originally developed by Jim Gettys, of Digital Equipment
Corporation (now part of HP).

Warren Turkal did the autotooling in October, 2003.

Josh Triplett, Jamey Sharp, and the XCB team (xcb@lists.freedesktop.org)
maintain the XCB support.

Individual developers include (in no particular order): Sebastien
Marineau, Holger Veit, Bruno Haible, Keith Packard, Bob Scheifler,

by Matt Dew, with assistance in editing & formatting tool setup from
Gaetan Nadon and Alan Coopersmith.

This work was supported by many organizations (in no particular
