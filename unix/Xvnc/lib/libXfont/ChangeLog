    fserve: Fix a buffer read overrun in _fs_client_access

    	crac.num_auths = set_font_authorizations(&authorizations, &authlen,
    						 client);
    	/* Work around bug in xfs versions up through modular release 1.0.8
    	   which rejects CreateAC packets with num_auths = 0 & authlen < 4 */
    	if (crac.num_auths == 0) {
    	    authorizations = padding;
    	    authlen = 4;
    	} else {
    	    authlen = (authlen + 3) & ~0x3;
    	}
    	crac.length = (sizeof (fsCreateACReq) + authlen) >> 2;
    	crac.acid = cur->acid;
    	_fs_add_req_log(conn, FS_CreateAC);
    	_fs_write(conn, (char *) &crac, sizeof (fsCreateACReq));
    	_fs_write(conn, authorizations, authlen);
    
    In the case in the report, set_font_authorizations setup authorizations as a
    34 byte buffer (and authlen set to 34 as one would expect). The following
    block changed authlen to 36 to make it 4byte aligned and the final _fs_write()
    caused us to read 36 bytes from this 34 byte buffer.
    
    This changes the incorrect size increase to instead use _fs_write_pad which
    takes care of the padding for us.

    Make shared library work on Cygwin/MinGW
    
    Weak symbols on PE platforms do not work the same way as on ELF
    platforms, hence we have been unable to have a fully functional shared
    libXfont until now.  This patch works around these issues so that we
    can fix that.
    
    In summary, only when compiling shared libraries on NO_WEAK_SYMBOLS
    platforms, when the first stub is called, the invoking program is first
    checked to determine if it exports the stubbed functions.  Then, for
    every stub call, if the function is exported by the loader, it is called
    instead of the stub code.
    
    serverClient and serverGeneration are data pointers, and therefore are
    replaced by getter functions. ErrorF is variadic, so the override is
    routed through VErrorF instead. FatalError has no va_list equivalent,
    but it is not actually used in libXfont and therefore should be safe to
    remove.
    
    This requires all X servers to export their symbols, which requires
    forthcoming patches for hw/xwin and xfs; the other xservers (including
    tigervnc) already do this via LD_EXPORT_SYMBOLS_FLAG.

    CVE-2014-0211: Integer overflow in fs_get_reply/_fs_start_read
    
    fs_get_reply() would take any reply size, multiply it by 4 and pass to
    _fs_start_read.  If that size was bigger than the current reply buffer
    size, _fs_start_read would add it to the existing buffer size plus the
    buffer size increment constant and realloc the buffer to that result.
    
    This math could overflow, causing the code to allocate a smaller
    buffer than the amount it was about to read into that buffer from
    the network.  It could also succeed, allowing the remote font server
    to cause massive allocations in the X server, possibly using up all
    the address space in a 32-bit X server, allowing the triggering of
    other bugs in code that fails to handle malloc failure properly.
    
    This patch protects against both problems, by disconnecting any
    font server trying to feed us more than (the somewhat arbitrary)
    64 mb in a single reply.

    CVE-2014-0210: unvalidated length in _fs_recv_conn_setup()
    
    The connection setup reply from the font server can include a list
    of alternate servers to contact if this font server stops working.
    
    The reply specifies a total size of all the font server names, and
    then provides a list of names. _fs_recv_conn_setup() allocated the
    specified total size for copying the names to, but didn't check to
    make sure it wasn't copying more data to that buffer than the size
    it had allocated.

    CVE-2014-0209: integer overflow of realloc() size in lexAlias()
    
    lexAlias() reads from a file in a loop. It does this by starting with a
    64 byte buffer.  If that size limit is hit, it does a realloc of the
    buffer size << 1, basically doubling the needed length every time the
    length limit is hit.
    
    Eventually, this will shift out to 0 (for a length of ~4gig), and that
    length will be passed on to realloc().  A length of 0 (with a valid
    pointer) causes realloc to free the buffer on most POSIX platforms,
    but the caller will still have a pointer to it, leading to use after
    free issues.

    CVE-2014-0209: integer overflow of realloc() size in FontFileAddEntry()
    
    FontFileReadDirectory() opens a fonts.dir file, and reads over every
    line in an fscanf loop.  For each successful entry read (font name,
    file name) a call is made to FontFileAddFontFile().
    
    FontFileAddFontFile() will add a font file entry (for the font name
    and file) each time it’s called, by calling FontFileAddEntry().
    FontFileAddEntry() will do the actual adding.  If the table it has
    to add to is full, it will do a realloc, adding 100 more entries
    to the table size without checking to see if that will overflow the
    int used to store the size.

    Don't leak old allocation if realloc fails to enlarge it
    
    In ftfuncs.c, since the buffer being reallocated is a function local
    buffer, used to accumulate data for a single run of the function and
    then freed at the end of the function, we just free the old buffer if
    realloc fails.
    
    In atom.c however, the ReverseMap is a static buffer, so we operate in
    temporary variables until we know we're successful, then update the
    static variables.  If we fail, we leave the old static variables in place,
    since they contain data about previous atoms we should maintain, not lose.

      - Support for the long-deprecated INCLUDES variable will be removed
        altogether in Automake 1.14.  The AM_CPPFLAGS variable should be
        used instead.
    
    This variable was deprecated in Automake releases prior to 1.10, which is
    the current minimum level required to build X.

    Support compress files with maxbits < 12
    
    The compress decompression code used by libXfont rejects valid archives
    with maxbits less than 12 (compress allows values 9 - 16, 16 is the
    default).  This is because maxbits-12 is used as index to hsize_table[].
    
    That looks like an incorrect port of the original compress code, where:
    - hsize depended on BITS, the maximum maxbits value supported by particular
      build, rather than on maxbits value from the particular input file
    - the same hsize was used for all BITS <= 12
    
    The quick way to verify the problem is:
      compress -b 11 fontfile.bdf
      bdftopcf -o /dev/null fontfile.bdf.Z
    which fails, while 12-16 works correctly.
    
    This fix removes hsize_table and uses 1 << maxbits (aka maxmaxcode) as
    tab_prefix size.  As decompression code does not use hashing as compression
    code, there does not seem to be a reason to allocate any extra space.
    
    Note: In this fix, maxbits == 9 is still rejected early.  AFAICS compress
    is able to generate such files (unknown how correct such output is), but is
    unable to uncompress them correctly.

    Revert "Bug #6247: Fix build on Cygwin"
    
    libtool requires the '-no-undefined' flag in order to create shared
    libraries on PE/COFF platforms (Cygwin/MinGW); on other platforms this
    flag has no effect.
    
    The problem with libXfont is that PE weak symbols do not behave exactly
    as they do on ELF platforms.  Since PE binaries (both executables and
    libraries) must have all symbols resolved at link time, there is no way
    for the real symbols in xserver to "displace" those in libXfont at
    runtime, so the result is that libXfont uses its stubs, which do
    nothing, and xserver ends up unable to find its fonts.
    
    Solving this will require either significant changes to libXfont or some
    major improvement to the toolchain to handle this case.  Until that
    happens, removing '-no-undefined' will result in a static-only library
    on these platforms, which is the only currently working solution.

    contain undefined symbols).  This produces a libXfont which might only
    be useful to the xserver, but the only other users we might care about
    are xfs, which is obsolete, and bdftopcf, which fortunately doesn't
    pull in any objects which reference serverGeneration from libXfont.

    Use one single function to register fpe functions
    
    X server doesn't need to understand fpe internals, so let it transparent
    turning all registration functions in a single one. For that, fill the already
    existent register_fpe_functions().
    
    Some X servers don't want font server support, so this patch also sets font
    server support to be configured in build time.
    
    In my machine, I see 20kB of RSS being saved in libXfont mapped in Xorg
    process when I disabled font server support and other kind of fonts in the
    library (--disable-pcfformat --disable-bdfformat --disable-snfformat
    --disable-freetype --disable-fc).
    
    The default library built was taking:
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename

    config: replace obsolete AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
    
    There are 2 headers to generate. The first one (config.h)
    is picked up by autoheader to generate the familiar config.h.in
    input file. The others in the list (or in subsequent AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
    macro calls) are generated from their existing matching template,
    e.g. fontconf.h.in.
    
    When multiple headers are listed in the same macro call,
    they cannot be separated by a new line like we do in AC_OUTPUT.

    libXfont ansification and removal of xf86_ansic.h dependency
    
      Basically the code is now compiled as if FONTMODULE was never defined,
    but also removed some "magic" defining _XOPEN_SOURCE before including
    math.h.
      Also removed some #if 0'ed code instead of fixing prototypes inside
    the "dead code".
      Changes to spdo_prv.h were due to defines like:
      <hash>define foo() sp_foo()
      that would not compile with the ansification in the format:
      type foo(void)
      due to the macro receiving "void" as an argument.

    Always scan catalogue dirs at startup, even if their mtime < 0
    
    Works around bug in VMWare that caused the Solaris kernel to fail to read
    the time-of-day chip on boot, and start with a time < 0 (i.e. back to the
    1960's) - when the system was then installed from this mode, Xorg wouldn't
    start after reboot, since the mtime would be < 0 and the catalogue dir was
    then skipped as not changed since reading at the 0 initially set in the
    cat->mtime.

    Do not call FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID() if configured with --disable-bdfformat
    
    When I configure libXfont-1.3.2 with --disable-bdfformat and link it against
    FreeType that is built without BDF support, I get the following link error:
    
    libXfont.so: undefined reference to ‘FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID’
    
    I fixed it by checking XFONT_BDFFORMAT and if BDF support is disabled, the call
    to FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID() is omitted and the result code is set as if the call
    had failed.

    The first time BuiltinReadDirectory() is called,
    save the content of builtin_dir and builtin_alias,
    before calling FontFileAddFontFile(), because that fonction
    will modify those.
    
    Then, in subsequent calls to BuiltinReadDirectory(), restore
    builtin_dir and builtin_alias so that the side effect incurred
    by the first call disappears.

    Add a new 'catalogue' FPE, which takes font paths from symlinks in a dir.
    
    This patch adds a new FPE type, which will match font path elements of the
    form
    
    	catalogue:<dir>
    
    The dir specified after the catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks
    and each symlink destination will be added as a local fontfile FPE.
    The symlink can be suffixed by attributes, such as 'unscaled', which
    will be passed through to the underlying fontfile FPE.  Except the new
    attribute 'pri' which will be used for ordering the fontfile FPEs.
    
    An example configuration:
    
    	75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -> /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
    	ghostscript:pri=60 -> /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
    	misc:unscaled:pri=10 -> /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc
    	type1:pri=40 -> /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1
    	type1:pri=50 -> /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1
    
    will add /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE with the attribute
    'unscaled', second FPE will be /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi, also with
    the attribute unscaled etc.  This is functionally equivalent to setting
    the following font path:
    
    	/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
    	/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
    	/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1,
    	/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,
    	/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
    
    The motivation is to let font packages add a symlink to the new font
    directory they provide instead of rewriting either the Xorg config file
    or the xfs config file.

    Updating to EDID 1.3. (Bugzilla# 1490, Jay Cotton, Egbert Eich).
    Removing unneeded code.
    Fixed KGA handling for i810. KGA handling for chips derived from C&T chips
        is slightly different. The changes make the code consistent with the
        C&T (chips) and i740 drivers.

    BugZilla #601: fixed missing symbols in Xserver freetype module due to
        using isdigit instead of ft_isdigit, missing or faulty defines for
        digit and string functions in ftstdlib.h (now myftstdlib.h). Reverted

        the use of a copy of ftconfig.h in lib/font/FreeType obsolete (Egbert
        Eich).

        is "pure."
