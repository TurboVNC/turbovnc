About libxcb
============

libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, which
replaces the current Xlib interface. It has several advantages over
Xlib, including:
- size: small, simple library, and lower memory footprint
- latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
- direct protocol access: interface and protocol correspond exactly
- proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads
- easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB

Xlib can also use XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make
requests and receive responses with both, which eases porting to XCB.
However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits will gain the most
benefit from a native XCB port.
