Please only one area per bug report.]

     SYNOPSIS:

[Brief description of the problem and where it is located]

     DESCRIPTION:

[Detailed description of problem.  Don't just say "<blah>
doesn't work, here's a fix," explain what your program does
to get to the <blah> state.  If this is a request for an
enhancement, justify it.]

     REPEAT BY:

[What you did to get the error; include test program or session
transcript if at all possible.  If you include a program, make
sure it depends only on libraries in the X distribution, not
on any vendor or third-party libraries.  Be specific; if we can't
reproduce it, we can't fix it.  Don't just say "run this program
and it will be obvious," tell us exactly what we should see when
the program is run.  Bug reports without a clear, deterministic
way of reproducing them will be fixed only after all bug reports
that do.]

     SAMPLE FIX:

[Preferred, but not necessary.  Please send context diffs (`diff 
-c original-file fixed-file`).  Be sure to include our "XConsortium" 
ident line in any diffs.  The best way to do this is to add your 
own versioning line immediately after ours.]

[PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
Subjects like "xterm bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!]
[Remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.]
