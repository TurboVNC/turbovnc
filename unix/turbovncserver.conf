## TurboVNC Server Configuration
##
## This file uses Perl syntax, although only one-line assignments
## are allowed.  Assignments can be applied to the following variables:
##
##  $autokill    -- 1 to automatically kill the TurboVNC session when the
##                  X startup script exits or 0 to leave it running
##                  [equivalent of -noautokill command-line option]
##  $depth       -- color depth in bits per pixel (8, 16, 24, 30, or 32)
##                  [equivalent of -depth command-line option]
##  $desktopName -- remote desktop name
##                  [equivalent of -name command-line option]
##  $fontPath    -- X11 font path
##                  [equivalent of -fp command-line option]
##  $generateOTP -- 1 to generate an initial one-time password.  (OTP
##                  authentication must be enabled and permitted)
##                  [equivalent of -otp command-line option]
##  $geometry    -- desktop geometry, WIDTHxHEIGHT or
##                  W0xH0+X0+Y0[,W1xH1+X1+Y1,...,WnxHn+Xn+Yn]
##                  [equivalent of -geometry command-line option]
##  $noVNC       -- directory containing noVNC
##                  [equivalent of -novnc command-line option]
##  $noxstartup  -- 1 to start the TurboVNC session with no X startup script
##                  [equivalent of -noxstartup command-line option]
##  $passwdFile  -- path to VNC password file to use with VNC Password
##                  authentication
##  $securityTypes -- comma-separated list of security types to enable
##                    (passed to Xvnc in the -securitytypes argument)
##  $serverArgs  -- additional arguments to pass to Xvnc (refer to the Xvnc man
##                  page for a list of accepted arguments)
##  $useUDS      -- listen on a Unix domain socket rather than a TCP port for
##                  connections from VNC viewers
##                  [equivalent of -uds command-line option]
##  $useVGL      -- 1 to run the window manager using VirtualGL.  This variable
##                  is ignored if $xstartup or $noxstartup is specified.
##                  [equivalent of -vgl command-line option]
##  $vncUserDir  -- path to TurboVNC user directory (session information, VNC
##                  passwords, and log files are stored here)
##  $wm          -- the window manager to use (for instance, "mate" or "2d"),
##                  which corresponds to a session desktop file under
##                  /usr/share/xsessions (/usr/local/share/xsessions on *BSD
##                  systems.)  This variable is ignored if $xstartup or
##                  $noxstartup is specified.
##                  [equivalent of -wm command-line option]
##  $x509CertFile -- path to X.509 signed certificate file (in PEM format) to
##                   use with X.509 encryption
##                   [equivalent of -x509cert command-line option]
##  $x509KeyFile -- path to X.509 private key file (in PEM format) to use with
##                  X.509 encryption
##                  [equivalent of -x509key command-line option]
##  $xstartup    -- path to alternative X startup script
##                  [equivalent of -xstartup command-line option]

# $autokill = 1;
# $depth = 24;
# $desktopName = "TurboVNC ($ENV{USER})";
# $fontPath = "";
# $generateOTP = 0;
# $geometry = "1240x900";
# $noVNC = "";
# $noxstartup = 0;

## Here is an example of setting the font path:
#
# $fontPath = "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
# $fontPath = "$fontPath,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/";

## You might wish to create the TurboVNC user directories under /tmp, to
## ensure that VNC passwords are always kept on the local filesystem.  To do
## that, uncomment the line below.  Note that in this case, Xvnc will search
## for the .Xauthority file in this same directory by default.
#
# $vncUserDir = "/tmp/$ENV{USER}-vnc";

## These settings are the default.  Uncomment and edit to change.
#
# $passwdFile = "$vncUserDir/passwd";
# $x509CertFile = "$vncUserDir/x509_cert.pem";
# $x509KeyFile = "$vncUserDir/x509_private.pem";
