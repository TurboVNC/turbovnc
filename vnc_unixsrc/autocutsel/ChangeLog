v0.9.0: 2006-11-05

v0.7.1: 2004-11-03
  - fixed compilation problems on some platforms

v0.7.0: 2004-09-11
  - fixed a bug when the first copy comes from the cutbuffer (jluu)
  - the -selection parameter now works
  - changed default selection to CLIPBOARD instead of PRIMARY (jluu)
    It means you now have to *COPY* and *PASTE* texts to have them handled
    by autocutsel. Just selecting text will only work in a few applications.
    If you want the old behavior, run "autocusel -selection PRIMARY"

    the cutbuffer was modified
  - added dmalloc support (to find memory leaks)

v0.4: 2002-05-19
  - perform a last check before owning the selection
    to handle properly applications updating both cutbuffer
    and selection
  - autoconf & automake scripts
  - improved debug messages
  - memory leak fixed?
  - minor bugfixes
	
v0.3:
  - applied a patch from Mark Warburton to ignore the cutbuffer
    value if it's empty
  - added -verbose (displays what -debug displayed before)
