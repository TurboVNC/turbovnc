 *     convexpoly.c
 *
 *     Written by Brian Kelleher; Dec. 1985.
 *
 *     Fill a convex polygon.  If the given polygon
 *     is not convex, then the result is undefined.
 *     The algorithm is to order the edges from smallest
 *     y to largest by partitioning the array into a left
 *     edge list and a right edge list.  The algorithm used
 *     to traverse each edge is an extension of Bresenham's
 *     line algorithm with y as the major axis.
 *     For a derivation of the algorithm, see the author of
 *     this code.
