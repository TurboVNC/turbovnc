	with these libraries for those who don't have them installed in the
	system, and another version without libraries, directly from CVS,
	for those who do have zlib and/or JPEG libraries installed. In the

	prevent potential dereference of a NULL pointer.

2001-11-22 04:13  const

	* vncviewer/: argsresources.c, rfbproto.c, vncviewer.h: Now viewer
	window is raised on beep, unless -noraiseonbeep option is provided
	or raiseOnBeep resource set to False.

2001-11-13 03:31  const

	* vncviewer/Imakefile: "ComplexProgramTargetNoMan" directive

2001-09-16 00:18  const

	* README, Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def, vncviewer/README: Version strings
	changed.

2001-09-15 22:58  const

	* vncviewer/: argsresources.c, tunnel.c, vncviewer.c, vncviewer.h:
	New -via <GATEWAY> vncviewer option providing enhanced tunneling
	functionality. Now one can make vncviewer tunnel connections to a
	VNC host via third machine acting as a gateway. Tunneling command
	template can be provided in the VNC_VIA_CMD environment variable
	containing %H, %L, %R, %G patterns where %G denotes host address of
	the gateway machine (%H, %L, %R patterns are similar to ones used
	in the VNC_TUNNEL_CMD template for -tunnel option). Default command
	template for the -via option invokes SSH port forwarding.

2001-09-15 04:12  const

	* vncviewer/vncviewer.h: Tunneling command template has been
	changed, to allow tunneled connections to hosts where only loopback
	VNC connections are enabled.

2001-09-06 00:34  const

	* vncpasswd/vncpasswd.c: Creating ~/.vnc directory if it does not
	exist, modified patch by Tim Waugh.

	environment variable applied, from Red Hat Linux RPM.

2001-06-18 06:17  const

	* vncviewer/Imakefile: Imakefile fix to compile the source under
	XFree86 4.1.0, the patch sent by Tim Waugh.

2001-03-01 00:48  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Two changes to lower
	latencies: (1) now we send pending data prior to processing of each
	rectangle if there is at least 128 bytes pending; (2) now, when we
	are trying to find solid-color areas and already have passed an
	amount of data which should be split anyway, we are sending them
	immediately.  A number of other minor clean-ups and fixes.

2001-03-01 00:35  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c: Contents of update buffer
	is not sent immediately any more. This change should prevent
	calling rfbSendUpdateBuf() with ublen==0 after a framebuffer
	update.

2001-03-01 00:31  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: Minor formatting
	clean-up and a check in rfbSendUpdateBuf() to make sure that (ublen
	> 0).

2001-02-28 20:35  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Minor clean-ups to get rid
	of all warnings on compilation with -Wall gcc option.

2001-02-17 07:50  const

	vncviewer/argsresources.c: Version strings changed.

2001-02-16 14:38  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Enhanced technique to split
	large rectangles: now we're trying to maximize dimensions of
	solid-color areas found.  Minor code clean-ups and formating fixes.

2001-02-15 01:21  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: rfb.h, rfbserver.c, tight.c:
	LastRect markers are not being sent when an update consist of small
	rectangles not to be searched for solid-color areas.  Minor
	performance fix: searches for solid-color areas might have been
	performed several times in the same area of rectangle.	Minor
	terminology fixes in names of functions implementing tight encoder
	and other minor code clean-ups.

2001-02-14 04:34  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Order in which parts of
	large rectangles are being sent is now strictly top-to-bottom,
	left-to-right. Such behaviour look better at client side.

2001-02-07 16:25  const

	* README, Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def, vncviewer/README,
	vncviewer/argsresources.c: Version strings changed.

2001-02-07 15:52  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Parameters for algorithms
	to split screen rectangles has been changed; this can improve both
	compression ratios and CPU usage.

2001-02-07 15:47  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Important bugfix in Xvnc
	tight encoder: the code to split large rectangles behaved
	incorrectly; this caused compression ratios to be worse than
	expected and could result segfaults in certain situations.

2001-02-02 14:48  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Bugfix: a typo fixed in the
	Xvnc that prevented it to communicate correctly with older viewers
	without JPEG compression support.

2001-02-01 00:24  const

	* vncviewer/: cursor.c, tight.c, argsresources.c: Tiny clean-up in
	vncviewer -help message.

2001-02-01 00:23  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/stats.c: Protocol overhead produced
	by LastRect is not counted as part of real framebuffer updates when
	statistics is dumped. This seems to be more correct.

2001-02-01 00:21  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: Bug fixed: LastRect
	pseudo-encoding worked incorrectly when preferred encoding was not
	Tight.

2001-01-31 16:57  const

	* README, Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def, vncviewer/README,
	vncviewer/argsresources.c: Version strings changed.

2001-01-31 15:56  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Rectangles prepared for
	indexed-color encoding are now may be compressed with JPEG on low
	quality levels.

2001-01-31 15:04  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: rfb.h, rfbserver.c, stats.c,
	tight.c: Large rectangles now should be split according to their
	contents: encoder tries to find large solid-color areas and to
	encode them in separate rectangles. This often reduces amount of
	data sent, improves compression speed and lowers latencies.

2001-01-31 08:37  const

	* vncviewer/rfbproto.c: Support for LastRect pseudo-encoding added.
	This fake encoding is used in empty rectangles indicating that
	there will be no more rectangles in current framebuffer update.

2001-01-30 08:24  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: rfb.h, rfbserver.c, tight.c: JPEG
	image quality in Xvnc tight encoder is now configurable.

2001-01-30 03:55  const

	* include/rfbproto.h, vncviewer/argsresources.c,
	vncviewer/rfbproto.c, vncviewer/vncviewer.h: Support for JPEG
	quality level setting in vncviewer, -quality option implemented.

2001-01-30 03:53  const

	* vncviewer/tight.c: Bugfix in colorspace translation from JPEG
	data.

2001-01-30 03:52  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: JPEG compression is now
	supported with any 16bpp and 32bpp server pixel formats.

2001-01-29 13:24  const

	* Xvnc/config/cf/vnclibs.def, Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c,
	include/rfbproto.h, vncviewer/Imakefile, vncviewer/rfbproto.c,
	vncviewer/tight.c: Preliminary implementation of JPEG compression.
	It works perfectly, but there are things to do: client should send
	explicit request for JPEG compression with quality level,
	algorithms to decide if a rectangle may be compressed by JPEG
	should be designed and implemented (for now JPEG compression just
	replaces Gradient filter).

2001-01-28 04:21  const

	* classes/: DesCipher.class, index.vnc: VNC Java viewer classes and
	HTML templates replaced with recently implemented Java version of
	TightVNC viewer.

2001-01-28 04:16  const

	* README, Xvnc/README, Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/README,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c, vncviewer/README,
	vncviewer/argsresources.c, vncviewer/tight.c, vncviewer/tunnel.c:
	Copyright and version strings changed.

2001-01-25 11:39  const

	* vncviewer/cursor.c: Bugfix: locked screen area calculation was
	broken on locks > 1.  Minor bugfix: there was 1 pixel error (safe)
	in code to determine collisions between software cursor and locked
	area.

2001-01-25 11:33  const

	* include/rfbproto.h: rfbEncodingLastRect added to list of known
	ensodings.

2001-01-24 09:53  const

	* vncviewer/cursor.c: Minor cleanups.

2001-01-21 20:52  const

	* vncviewer/: Vncviewer, argsresources.c: vncviewer now requests
	shared session by default, "-noshared" option supported to alter
	this behaviour.

2001-01-17 03:03  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: init.c, rfb.h, sockets.c: Code
	cleanup in Xvnc -interface option implementation, from TridiaVNC.

2001-01-16 15:17  const

	* vncviewer/cursor.c: Minor code cleanups.

2001-01-16 14:26  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/corre.c: Bug fixed: CoRRE
	implementation refused to check return codes after writing data to
	clients; this caused Xvnc crashes after write operation into closed
	descriptor.

2001-01-16 13:37  const

	* vncviewer/desktop.c: Minor change in dot cursor shape (rounded).

2001-01-16 12:47  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c: Transparent 1x1 cursor is
	treated as "no cursor" (width 0, height 0).

2001-01-16 12:20  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: init.c, kbdptr.c, rfb.h: New
	-compatiblekbd option implemented in Xvnc to force META and ALT
	keys behave the same way as they do in the original AT&T's version
	(they both correspond to the Mod1 modifier there).

2001-01-16 11:55  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/: init.c, rfb.h, sockets.c: Support
	for Xvnc -interface option added (patch from Tim Waught).

2001-01-16 00:16  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/Imakefile,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfb.h,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/zlib.c, include/rfbproto.h,
	vncviewer/rfbproto.c, vncviewer/vncviewer.h, vncviewer/zlib.c: Zlib
	encoding support merged from the TridiaVNC code.

2001-01-16 00:07  const

	* vncviewer/listen.c: XBell volume changed from 100 to 0.

2001-01-16 00:07  const

	* vncviewer/: Vncviewer, argsresources.c: Version info changed,
	minor typo fixed.

2001-01-15 23:17  const

	* Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def: Version string changed to indicate Tight
	Encoder version.

2001-01-15 21:17  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: Server-side priorities
	for XCursor vs. RichCursor encodings have been changed: now XCursor
	is used for any client supporting this encoding even if it sends
	request for RichCursor encoding first.

2001-01-15 18:10  const

	* vncviewer/rfbproto.c: Minor cosmetic change.

2001-01-15 17:45  const

	* vncviewer/: cursor.c, rfbproto.c, vncviewer.h: RichCursor
	encoding support is finished.

2001-01-15 08:34  const

	* vncviewer/cursor.c: Code cleanups.

2001-01-14 19:54  const

	* vncviewer/: argsresources.c, cursor.c, rfbproto.c, sockets.c,
	tight.c, tunnel.c, vncviewer.c, vncviewer.h: Coding style fixes,
	spaces -> tabs (mostly in my own code).

2001-01-14 14:55  const

	* vncviewer/: cursor.c, rfbproto.c, vncviewer.h: Preliminary
	client-side RichCursor encoding support. Currently it works but the
	way to prevent collisions between framebuffer updates and cursor
	drawing operations is not reliable enough.

2001-01-14 14:51  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c: Bug with
	XCursor->RichCursor format translation fixed.

2001-01-11 16:36  const

	* vncviewer/rfbproto.c: Requesting RichCursor encoding, processing
	RichCursor updates.

2001-01-11 16:35  const

	* vncviewer/vncviewer.h: MAX_ENCODINGS raised to 20.

2001-01-11 16:19  const

	* vncviewer/: Imakefile, cursor.c, rfbproto.c, vncviewer.h: All
	XCursor stuff moved from rfbproto.c to a new file, cursor.c.

2001-01-06 07:00  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c: Xvnc bit-order problems in
	XCursor/RichCursor encodings hopefully fixed.

2001-01-05 11:05  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Constant sets for
	compression levels 0 and 1 changed.  Minor code cleanups and
	optimizations.	Comments clarified, typos in comments fixed.

2001-01-05 11:02  const

	* vncviewer/tight.c: Tiny typo fixed in comment.

2000-12-08 15:28  const

	* vncviewer/tight.c: Bugfix: viewer crashed in rare situations
	after inflate() call when decompressed data filled the whole output
	buffer but there was no more input data.  Additionally, one more
	sprintf(stderr, ...) added to inflate() error processing code to
	catch such kind of errors in the future.

2000-11-30 12:22  const

	* vncviewer/rfbproto.c: Buffer size for incoming compressed data
	decreased to lower latencies.

2000-11-20 10:18  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c: Minor change in comment.

2000-11-16 19:02  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Unused variable removed.

2000-11-14 06:07  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/tight.c: Code cleanups. No logic
	changes.

2000-11-10 02:20  const

	* vncconnect/vncconnect.c: Tiny patch from Tim Waugh applied to
	correct typo in a message text.

2000-11-10 02:18  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/cfb/cfbcmap.c: Order and priority of color
	components in default pixel format have been changed. This should
	resolve problems with imlib renderer and get rid of unneeded pixel
	format translations in many cases.

2000-11-02 13:55  const

	* vncviewer/: rfbproto.c, tunnel.c, vncviewer.h: When -tunnel
	option was specified in the command line, special rules are used to
	choose preferred encoding. Now viewer does not think that server is
	running on the same machine when tunneling is on and preferred
	encoding is "tight" with default compression instead of raw.

2000-11-02 13:05  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/cfb/cfbcmap.c: Rules to set default pixel
	formats have been changed: if depth/3 is not integral number, then
	red component will take (depth+1)/3 bits instead of (depth+2)/3
	bits. So default pixel format for 16bpp is BGR565 instead of
	BGR556.

2000-10-31 11:57  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/Imakefile,
	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/cursor.c,

	Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/stats.c, include/rfbproto.h,
	vncviewer/rfbproto.c: New "RichCursor" encoding implemented. 
	Background and foreground colors are not sent for empty XCursor
	updates any more. Note: compatibility with previous XCursor code
	lost.  Actual bit order in X11 bitmaps did not correspond to
	XCursor encoding specification. Note: compatibility with previous
	XCursor code lost.

2000-10-31 02:13  const

	* Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: (rfbSendXCursorShape):
	XCursor encoding change: order in which transparency and data
	bitmaps follow is now opposite (first data, then mask).

2000-10-31 01:46  const

	* vncviewer/rfbproto.c: (HandleXCursor): XCursor encoding change:
	order in which transparency and data bitmaps follow is now opposite
	(first data, then mask).

2000-10-31 01:43  const

	* include/rfbproto.h: Description for XCursor encoding changed,
	order in which transparency and data bitmaps follow is now opposite
	(first data, then mask).

2000-10-31 01:31  const

	vncviewer/argsresources.c, vncviewer/desktop.c,
	vncviewer/rfbproto.c, vncviewer/vncviewer.h: "XCursor" encoding
	implemented. It's used to send X-style cursor shape information
	from server to clients so cursor movement can be processed at
	client side.

2000-10-29 11:30  const

	* vncviewer/: argsresources.c, vncviewer.h: Vncviewer's
	-nolocalcursor option removed.

2000-10-26 13:42  const

	* vncviewer/argsresources.c: Version string changed.

2000-10-26 13:02  const

	not on 3.3.3r1.

2000-10-26 11:56  const

	* include/rfbproto.h: Preparing for local cursor implementation.
	New constants and comments.

2000-10-26 04:59  const
