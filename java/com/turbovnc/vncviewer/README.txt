Java TurboVNC Viewer
====================

The Java TurboVNC Viewer is based largely on the Java TigerVNC Viewer, but it
contains additional features and GUI modifications that make it behave and
perform as much like the TurboVNC native viewers as possible.  One of the
most notable of these features is the ability to use the libjpeg-turbo library
(through JNI) to accelerate JPEG decoding, giving the Java TurboVNC Viewer,
when run as a standalone application, similar levels of performance to the
native TurboVNC Viewer.

The Java TurboVNC Viewer also contains code from other sources.  See the
Acknowledgements section below and the individual files for details of the
conditions under which they are made available.


Installation
============

There are three basic ways to use the Java TurboVNC Viewer:

  1. Running the viewer as a standalone application.

     On Mac platforms, the Java TurboVNC Viewer is bundled as a self-contained
     app and can be launched by opening the "TurboVNC Viewer" app located in
     the "TurboVNC" Applications folder.  On Mac or Un*x platforms, the Java
     TurboVNC Viewer can be launched by running /opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
     from a command prompt.  On Windows platforms, the Java TurboVNC Viewer can
     be launched by selecting "Java TurboVNC Viewer" in the "TurboVNC" Start
     Menu group or by running c:\Program Files\TurboVNC\vncviewer-java.bat from
     a command prompt.  See the TurboVNC User's Guide for more information.

     The Java TurboVNC Viewer can also be launched directly on the command line
     using the "java" command (useful for developers):

         java -jar VncViewer.jar [parameters]

     Add an argument of -? to the above command line to print a list of
     optional parameters supported by the viewer.

  2. Running the viewer as a Java Web Start app using the TurboVNC Server.

     The TurboVNC Server includes a small built-in HTTP server that can serve
     the Java TurboVNC Viewer to web clients.  This enables easy access to the
     remote desktop without the need to install any software on the client
     machine.

     The TurboVNC Server (Xvnc) is able to serve up any set of files that
     are present in a particular directory, which is specified in the -httpd
     argument to Xvnc.  In the default version of the vncserver script, this
     argument is set to ../java, relative to the directory containing the
     vncserver script.  Thus, one can easily deploy a modified version of
     the Java TurboVNC Viewer by simply copying a new JAR file into this
     directory.

  3. Running the viewer from a standalone web server.

     Another possibility for using the Java TurboVNC Viewer is to install it
     under a fully-functional HTTP server, such as Apache.  Using Java Web
     Start, the native libjpeg-turbo JNI JARs can be deployed along with the
     viewer, creating a zero-install feature-rich VNC viewer solution with
     optimal performance.  See the TurboVNC User's Guide for more information.


Parameters
==========

The Java TurboVNC Viewer accepts a number of optional parameters, allowing you
to customize its behavior.

Parameters can be specified in one of the two ways, depending on how the Java
TurboVNC Viewer is used:

  1. When the Java TurboVNC Viewer is launched via Java Web Start, parameters
     should be specified in <argument> tags in the JNLP file.  Example:

     <application-desc main-class="com.turbovnc.vncviewer.VncViewer">
       <argument>Port=5901</argument>
       <argument>Scale=50</argument>
     </application-desc>

  3. When run as a standalone application, the Java TurboVNC Viewer reads
     parameters from the command line.  Example:

     java -jar VncViewer.jar Port=5901 Scale=50

     or

     java -jar VncViewer.jar -port 5901 -scale 50

Both parameter names and their values are case-insensitive.  The only
exception is the value passed to the "Password" parameter, as VNC passwords are
case-sensitive.

For a complete list of parameters and their descriptions, execute:

     java -jar VncViewer.jar -?
