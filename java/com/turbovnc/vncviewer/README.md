TurboVNC Viewer
===============

The TurboVNC Viewer was originally based on the Java TigerVNC Viewer, but it
contains numerous additional features and GUI modifications that make it behave
and perform like a native VNC viewer.


The TurboVNC Helper
-------------------

When run as a standalone application, the TurboVNC Viewer implements some
low-level platform-specific features by way of a bundled JNI library called the
"TurboVNC Helper."  The following features require the TurboVNC Helper:

### All Platforms

* Accelerated JPEG decompression using libjpeg-turbo

### Windows

* Keyboard grabbing (passing Alt-Tab and other special keystrokes to the
  server)
* Pageant support (for password-less SSH public key authentication)

### Mac

* Drawing tablet support
* ssh-agent support (for password-less SSH public key authentication)

### Linux/Un*x

* Keyboard grabbing
* Remote X Input/extended input device support
* Multi-screen spanning in full-screen mode
* ssh-agent support (for password-less SSH public key authentication)

You can verify that the TurboVNC Helper has been loaded by checking the
"Connection Info" dialog (after the connection to the server has been
established.)  If you are launching the TurboVNC Viewer from the command line,
then it will also print a warning if it is unable to load the helper.


Blitting Performance
--------------------

The TurboVNC Viewer includes a benchmark that can be used to diagnose
performance problems with Java 2D.  In order to run the benchmark, execute the
following command in a Command Prompt/terminal window:

### Windows

    java -Dsun.java2d.trace=count -cp "c:\Program Files\TurboVNC\Java\VncViewer.jar" com.turbovnc.vncviewer.ImageDrawTest

### Mac

    java -Dsun.java2d.trace=count -cp /Applications/TurboVNC/TurboVNC\ Viewer.app/Contents/Resources/Java/VncViewer.jar com.turbovnc.vncviewer.ImageDrawTest

### Linux/Un*x

    java -Dsun.java2d.trace=count -cp /opt/TurboVNC/java/VncViewer.jar com.turbovnc.vncviewer.ImageDrawTest

Let the benchmark run until it produces stable results, then abort it with
CTRL-C.  Looking at the Java 2D trace output will reveal which underlying API
is being used to draw the images.  This should generally be OpenGL on Mac
platforms and Windows GDI on Windows platforms.
