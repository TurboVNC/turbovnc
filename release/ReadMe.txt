Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to view and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote computer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine and send only the pixels generated by these applications to your local machine.  VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems and architectures as both servers and clients.

TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image-intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of applications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.

This package includes the TurboVNC Viewer, which provides optimal performance when connecting to the TurboVNC Server.

Refer to the TurboVNC User's Guide (a link to which is provided in the "TurboVNC" Applications folder) for usage information.
