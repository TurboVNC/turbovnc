* Compatibility Guide
{anchor: Compatibility}

In order to realize the full benefits of TurboVNC, it is necessary to use the
TurboVNC Server and the TurboVNC Viewer in concert.  However, TurboVNC is fully
compatible with TigerVNC, TightVNC, RealVNC, and other VNC flavors.  You can
use the TurboVNC Viewer to connect to a non-TurboVNC server (or vice versa),
although this will generally result in some decrease in performance, and
features such as the [[#TurboVNC_Session_Manager][TurboVNC Session Manager]]
will not be available.

The following sections list additional things to bear in mind when mixing
TurboVNC with other VNC flavors.

** TightVNC or TigerVNC Servers

	* TightVNC and TigerVNC specify the JPEG quality level on a scale from 0 to 9.
		This translates to actual JPEG quality as follows:

		TightVNC JPEG Quality Levels :: {:}
		|| JPEG quality level    || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 ||
		| Actual JPEG quality    |  5 | 10 | 15 | 25 | 37 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 75 | 80 |
		| Actual chrominance subsampling | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 2X |
		#OPT: hiCol=first

		{anchor: TigerVNC_JPEG_Qual}
		TigerVNC JPEG Quality Levels :: {:}
		|| JPEG quality level         ||  0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 ||  9 ||
		| Actual JPEG quality         |  15 | 29 | 41 | 42 | 62 | 77 | 79 | 86 | 92 | 100 |
		| Actual chrominance subsampling |  4X | 4X | 4X | 2X | 2X | 2X | 1X | 1X | 1X |  1X |
		| Average compression ratio * | 100 | 80 | 70 | 60 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 25 | 20 |  10 |
		#OPT: hiCol=first

		!!! * Experimentally determined by compressing every 10th frame in the
		SPECviewperf 9 benchmark suite

	TurboVNC, on the other hand, includes extensions to Tight encoding that
	allow the JPEG quality to be specified on the standard 1-100 scale and
	allow the JPEG chrominance subsampling to be specified seperately.
	TigerVNC 1.2 (and later) includes the same extensions on the server side, so
	the TigerVNC 1.2+ Server will behave like the TurboVNC Server when a
	TurboVNC viewer is connected to it.
	{nl}{nl}
	When a TurboVNC viewer is connected to a TightVNC or TigerVNC 1.0/1.1 server,
	setting the JPEG quality to N in the TurboVNC Viewer sets the JPEG quality
	level to N/10 on the TightVNC or TigerVNC server.  For instance, if you set
	the JPEG quality to 95 in the TurboVNC Viewer, this would translate to a JPEG
	quality level of 9, which would set the actual JPEG quality/subsampling to
	80/2X if connected to a TightVNC server or 100/1X if connected to a TigerVNC
	1.0/1.1 server.
	{nl}{nl}

	* Changing the JPEG chrominance subsampling option in the TurboVNC Viewer has
		no effect when connected to a TightVNC or TigerVNC 1.0/1.1 server.
		{nl}{nl}

	* Normally, the TurboVNC Viewer GUI only allows you to select the compression
		levels that are useful for TurboVNC servers, but you can specify
		additional compression levels on the TurboVNC Viewer command line.  You
		can also pass an argument of ''-compatiblegui'' to the viewer to expose all
		10 compression levels in the GUI, which is useful when connecting to
		non-TurboVNC servers.  It should be noted, however, that our experiments
		have shown that compression levels higher than 5 are generally not useful
		in the TightVNC or TigerVNC Servers.  They increase CPU usage exponentially
		without providing any significant savings in bandwidth relative to
		Compression Level 5.
		{nl}{nl}

	* TurboVNC supports an extension to Tight encoding that allows the
		server to tell the viewer not to use zlib to decompress a particular
		subrectangle.  Zlib introduces a tremendous amount of performance overhead,
		even when zlib compression level 0 (no compression) is used.  Thus, when a
		TurboVNC viewer requests Compression Level 0 from the TurboVNC Server,
		the TurboVNC Server bypasses zlib altogether.  TightVNC and TigerVNC
		servers do not support this extension, and thus they will still use zlib to
		"compress" the framebuffer updates even if you request Compression Level 0
		using the TurboVNC Viewer.
		{nl}{nl}

	* When properly configured, version 1.2 and later (except for versions
		1.4.0 - 1.4.2, which contained a performance regression) of the TigerVNC
		Server can be made to perform similarly to a single-threaded instance of
		the TurboVNC Server.  However, all other versions of TigerVNC and TightVNC
		will use much more CPU time across the board than the TurboVNC Server, all
		else being equal.  With JPEG enabled, Compression Levels 1 and 2 in
		TigerVNC are roughly equivalent to the same compression levels in TurboVNC,
		except that TigerVNC enables interframe comparison automatically with
		Compression Level 2 and above.

** TightVNC or TigerVNC Viewers

	* The TurboVNC Server will attempt to emulate the behavior of a TigerVNC
		server and will translate JPEG quality levels into actual JPEG quality and
		subsampling, as specified in {ref prefix="Section ": TigerVNC_JPEG_Qual}.
		{nl}{nl}

	* When either a TightVNC or TigerVNC viewer is connected to a TurboVNC
		server and JPEG subencoding is disabled, setting the compression level to 0
		in the viewer will cause the connection to abort with a "bad subencoding
		value" error.  This is because the TurboVNC Server is attempting to send
		the framebuffer updates with no zlib compression, and the TightVNC and
		TigerVNC viewers don't support this.
		{nl}{nl}
		A similar issue occurs when using more than four encoding threads in the
		server.  Since the Tight encoding type is limited to four zlib streams,
		any encoding threads beyond the first four cannot use zlib compression.
		{nl}{nl}

	* Refer to {ref prefix="Section ": AdvancedCompression} for a description of
		how the TurboVNC Server responds to requests for Compression Levels 0-9.

** RealVNC

The TurboVNC Viewer supports the Hextile, Raw, and ZRLE encoding types, which
are compatible with RealVNC.  None of these encoding types can be selected from
the TurboVNC Viewer GUI, but Hextile or ZRLE will be selected automatically
when connecting to a RealVNC server.  Non-Tight encoding types, such as Hextile
and Raw, can also be manually selected from the TurboVNC Viewer command line.
In addition to Hextile, Raw, and ZRLE, the TurboVNC Server also supports the
RRE, CoRRE, and Zlib legacy encoding types, for compatibility with older VNC
viewers.

All of the non-Tight encoding types have performance drawbacks.  Raw encoding
requires gigabit in order to achieve decent performance, and it can easily take
up an entire gigabit connection's worth of bandwidth (it also doesn't perform
particularly well with the TurboVNC Viewer, because of the need to convert the
pixels from bytes to ints in Java.)  Hextile uses very small tiles, which
causes it to incur a large amount of computational overhead.  It compresses too
poorly to perform well on slow links but uses too much CPU time to perform well
on fast links.  ZRLE improves upon this, but it is still too computationally
intense for fast networks.  The ''vncviewer'' man page in the TurboVNC Linux
packages has some additional information about how Hextile and ZRLE work.
