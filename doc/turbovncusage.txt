* Using TurboVNC
{anchor: TurboVNC_Usage}

** Starting and Connecting to a TurboVNC Session

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window on your client machine.

	#. In the new Command Prompt/terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSH)
		session into the TurboVNC server machine:

		Linux/Un*x/Mac clients :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		ssh {user}@{server}
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace __''{user}''__ with your username on the TurboVNC server
		machine and __''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that
		machine.

	#. In the SSH session, start a TurboVNC session:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver
		---

	#. Make a note of the X display number that the TurboVNC session is
		occupying, for instance:
		{nl}{nl}
		''Desktop 'TurboVNC: my_server:1 (my_user)' started on display my_server:1''
		{nl}{nl}
		If this is the first time that a TurboVNC session has ever been run
		under this user account, and if VNC password authentication is enabled for
		the session, then TurboVNC will prompt for a VNC password.

	#. The SSH session can now be exited, if desired.

	#. On the client machine, start the TurboVNC Viewer.

		Linux/Un*x clients :: {:}
		Open a new terminal/xterm and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Mac clients :: {:}
		Open the "TurboVNC Viewer" application, located in the "TurboVNC"
		Applications folder.

		Windows clients :: {:}
		Select "TurboVNC Viewer" in the "TurboVNC" Start Menu group.

	#. A small dialog box will appear.
		{nl}{nl}
		|| Windows TurboVNC Viewer || Linux/Un*x/Mac (Java) TurboVNC Viewer ||
		| {img:newconn-win.png} | {img:newconn-java.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the X display name (hostname, or IP address, and display number) of
		the TurboVNC session in the "VNC server" field, then click "Connect".

	#. Another dialog box appears, prompting for the password (if Standard
		VNC authentication is being used) or for the username and password (if
		Unix Login authentication is being used.)
		{nl}{nl}
		|| || Windows TurboVNC Viewer || Linux/Un*x/Mac (Java) TurboVNC Viewer ||
		| Standard VNC Authentication Dialog | {img:vncauth-win.png} | {img:vncauth-java.png} |
		| Unix Login Authentication Dialog   | {img:unixauth-win.png} | {img:unixauth-java.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the VNC session password or the Unix username/password and click
		"OK" (Windows) or press Enter (Linux/Un*x/Mac.)
		{nl}{nl}
		A TurboVNC desktop window should appear on your client machine.  This
		window contains a virtual desktop with which you can interact to launch
		X-Windows applications on the TurboVNC server machine.

*** Window Manager Compatibility

This version of the TurboVNC Server can run 3D (compositing) window managers
(such as Unity or GNOME 3+ or KDE 5+) using its built-in software OpenGL
implementation, and it also provides an option (''-vgl'') that allows for
running 3D window managers using VirtualGL.  However, for performance reasons,
it is generally recommended that you use a 2D window manager with the TurboVNC
Server (even with VirtualGL, 3D window managers have a lot of overhead.)  As of
this writing, Ubuntu provides an optional 2D window manager called "GNOME
Fallback" or "GNOME Flashback", which will automatically be used if it is
installed and the ''TVNC_WM'' environment variable is set to ''2d''.  For other
systems that lack a 2D window manager, it is recommended that you install MATE.
Refer to
[[http://www.turbovnc.org/Documentation/Compatibility][this report]] for an
up-to-date list of window managers that have been tested with this version of
the TurboVNC Server, how to configure the TurboVNC Server to use those window
managers, and a list of known compatibility issues.

** Disconnecting and Killing a TurboVNC Session

Closing the TurboVNC Viewer disconnects from the TurboVNC session, but the
TurboVNC session will remain running on the TurboVNC server machine (as will
any applications that you may have started within the session), and you can
reconnect to the session at any time.

To kill a TurboVNC session:

	#. Using SSH (''c:\\Program Files\\TurboVNC\\putty.exe'' on Windows clients),
		log into the server machine that is running the TurboVNC session you want
		to kill.{nl} \
		... or ...{nl} \
		Using the TurboVNC Viewer, connect to the TurboVNC session that you want to
		kill, and open a new terminal in that TurboVNC session.

	#. Type the following command:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :{n}
		---

	Replace __''{n}''__ with the X display number of the TurboVNC session you
	want to kill.

To list the X display numbers and process ID's of all TurboVNC sessions
currently running under your user account on a particular server machine, type
the following command:

	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list
	---

** Launching the TurboVNC Viewer from a Web Browser
{anchor: Zero_Install}

When a TurboVNC session is created, it automatically starts a miniature web
server that serves up the Java TurboVNC Viewer as a Java Web Start app.  This
allows you to easily connect to the TurboVNC session from a machine that does
not have the TurboVNC Viewer installed locally.  If one of the official
TurboVNC binary packages is installed on the server, then the miniature web
server will automatically send the appropriate x86 or x86-64 libjpeg-turbo JNI
library for Linux, OS X, or Windows clients when launching the TurboVNC Viewer.
This provides most of the advantages of the standalone TurboVNC viewers,
including native levels of performance on popular client platforms.

To launch the Java TurboVNC Viewer from a web browser, point your web browser
to:

''http://''__''{turbovnc_server}''__'':{5800+''__''n''__''}''

where __''{turbovnc_server}''__ is the hostname or IP address of the TurboVNC
server machine, and __''n''__ is the X display number of the TurboVNC session
to which you want to connect.

__Example:__
If the TurboVNC session is occupying X display ''my_server:1'', then point your
web browser to:

''http://my_server:5801''

This will download a JNLP file to your computer, which you can open in Java
Web Start.

You can add viewer parameters to the URL using the following format:

''http://''__''{turbovnc_server}''__'':{5800+''__''n''__''}?''__''{param1}''__''=''__''{value1}''__''&''__''{param2}''__''=''__''{value2}''__

Example:

''http://my_server:5801?tunnel=1&samp=2x&quality=80''

will tunnel the VNC connection through SSH and enable Medium-Quality JPEG.

	!!! NOTE: As of Java 7 Update 51, self-signed JARs are not allowed to run in
	Java Web Start by default.  This is not an issue if you are using the
	official TurboVNC binary packages, but if you are building a self-signed
	version of the Java TurboVNC Viewer for development purposes, then you will
	need to add ''http://{turbovnc_server}:{http_port}'' (for example,
	''http://my_server:5801'') to Java's Exception Site List, which can be found
	under the "Security" tab in the Java Control Panel.

	!!! NOTE: On some newer OS X systems, downloading a JNLP file may result
	in an error: "xxxxxxxx.jnlp can't be opened because it it from an
	unidentified developer."  To work around this, you can either open the JNLP
	file directly from your Downloads folder, or you can change the application
	security settings in the "Security & Privacy" section of System Preferences
	to allow applications downloaded from anywhere.

** Deploying the Java TurboVNC Viewer Using Java Web Start
{anchor: JWS}

Accessing the Java TurboVNC Viewer through TurboVNC's built-in HTTP server, as
described above, is a quick and easy way of running the TurboVNC Viewer on
machines that don't already have a VNC viewer installed (for instance, for the
purpose of collaborating with colleagues who don't normally use TurboVNC.)

To set up a large-scale deployment of the Java TurboVNC Viewer, however, it is
desirable to serve up the JAR files from a dedicated web server.

For the purposes of this guide, it is assumed that the reader has some
knowledge of web server administration.

	* Copy the Java TurboVNC Viewer JAR file (''VncViewer.jar'') into a directory
		on your web server.
		{nl}{nl}

	* Copy the libjpeg-turbo JNI JAR files into that same directory.  You can
		obtain these from one of the official TurboVNC 2.0 or later binary packages
		for Linux, or you can download ''libjpeg-turbo-{version}-jws.zip'' from
		libjpeg-turbo 1.4.0 or later (available at
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files]].)  Note that only
		the JARs included in the official TurboVNC packages are signed using an
		official code signing certificate.
		{nl}{nl}

	* __OPTIONAL:__ Copy the TurboVNC Helper JAR files into that same directory.
		You can obtain these from ''turbovnc-{version}-jws.zip'', which is supplied
		with official releases of TurboVNC 2.1.2 and later (available at
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files]].)
		{nl}{nl}

	* __OPTIONAL:__ For large organizations, it may be desirable to obtain your
		own code signing certificate from a trusted certificate authority and use
		''jarsigner'' to sign all of the JARs with that certificate.  The specifics
		of this are left as an exercise for the reader.
		{nl}{nl}

	* Create a file called ''TurboVNC.jnlp'' in the same directory as
		''VncViewer.jar'' on the web server, and give it the following contents:

		#Verb: <<---
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<jnlp codebase="{turbovnc_url}">
		  <information>
		    <title>TurboVNC Viewer</title>
		    <vendor>The VirtualGL Project</vendor>
		  </information>

		  <resources>
		    <jar href="VncViewer.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <security>
		    <all-permissions/>
		  </security>

		  <resources os="Mac OS X">
		    <j2se version="1.8+" java-vm-args="-server"/>
		    <nativelib href="ljtosx.jar"/>
		    <!-- Enable drawing tablet support for OS X clients -->
		    <nativelib href="tvnchelper-osx.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <resources os="Windows" arch="x86">
		    <j2se version="1.8+" java-vm-args="-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false"/>
		    <nativelib href="ljtwin32.jar"/>
		    <!-- Enable keyboard grabbing for 32-bit Windows clients -->
		    <nativelib href="tvnchelper-win32.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <resources os="Windows" arch="amd64">
		    <j2se version="1.8+" java-vm-args="-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false"/>
		    <nativelib href="ljtwin64.jar"/>
		    <!-- Enable keyboard grabbing for 64-bit Windows clients -->
		    <nativelib href="tvnchelper-win64.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <resources os="Linux" arch="i386">
		    <j2se version="1.8+" java-vm-args="-server"/>
		    <nativelib href="ljtlinux32.jar"/>
		    <!-- Enable keyboard grabbing, multi-screen spanning, and extended
		         input device support for 32-bit Linux clients -->
		    <nativelib href="tvnchelper-linux32.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <resources os="Linux" arch="amd64">
		    <j2se version="1.8+"/>
		    <nativelib href="ljtlinux64.jar"/>
		    <!-- Enable keyboard grabbing, multi-screen spanning, and extended
		         input device support for 64-bit Linux clients -->
		    <nativelib href="tvnchelper-linux64.jar"/>
		  </resources>

		  <application-desc main-class="com.turbovnc.vncviewer.VncViewer"/>
		</jnlp>
		---

		!!! NOTE: ''{turbovnc_url}'' should be the absolute URL of the TurboVNC
		Viewer directory on the web server, e.g. ''http://my_server/turbovnc''.

		!!! NOTE: Leave out the lines referring to ''tvnchelper-*.jar'' if you have
		not installed the TurboVNC Helper JARs.

		This is just a minimal example.  Refer to the
		[[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/][Java Web Start documentation]]
		for additional fields that you might want to add.
		{nl}{nl}

	* You should now be able to access ''{turbovnc_url}/TurboVNC.jnlp'' in your
		browser to launch the Java TurboVNC Viewer with full performance.

** Securing a TurboVNC Connection
{anchor: Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}

Normally, the connection between the TurboVNC Server and the TurboVNC Viewer is
completely unencrypted, but securing that connection can be easily
accomplished by using the port forwarding feature of Secure Shell (SSH.)  After
you have started a TurboVNC session on the TurboVNC server machine, open a new
SSH connection into the TurboVNC server machine using the following command
line:

	Linux/Un*x/Mac clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L {5900+n}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	---

	Windows clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" -L {5900+n}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	---

Replace __''{user}''__ with your username on the TurboVNC server
machine and __''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that machine.
Replace __''n''__ with the X display number of the TurboVNC session to which
you want to connect.

For instance, if you want to connect to display '':1'' on server ''my_server''
using user account ''my_user'', you would type:

	Linux/Un*x/Mac clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 my_user@my_server
	---

	Windows clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" -L 5901:localhost:5901 my_user@my_server
	---

After the SSH connection has been established, you can then launch the
TurboVNC Viewer and point it to ''localhost:''__''{n}''__ (''localhost:1'' in the
above example.)

	!!! You can force PuTTY to use an IPv6 interface for the local end of the
	tunnel by replacing ''-L'' with ''-L6'' in the above command line.

	!!! For LAN connections and other high-speed networks, tunneling the TurboVNC
	connection through PuTTY will reduce performance by as much as 20%.

*** The ''-via'' and ''-tunnel'' Command-Line Options
#OPT: noList! plain!

If you are using the Java TurboVNC Viewer (which you are if you are using a
Mac, Linux, or Un*x platform), then you can simplify the above by using the
''-via'' and ''-tunnel'' command-line options, or the equivalent GUI options
(located under the "Security" tab in the Options dialog.)  For instance,
running

	#Verb: <<---
	{vncviewer} -via {user}@{server} localhost:{n}
	---

or

	#Verb: <<---
	{vncviewer} -tunnel {user}@{server}
	---

is the equivalent of running

	#Verb: <<---
	/usr/bin/ssh -L {fp}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	{vncviewer} localhost::{fp}
	---

where __''{fp}''__ is a free TCP port on the client machine (this is
automatically determined by the TurboVNC Viewer.)

	!!! In the above examples, ''{vncviewer}'' is the command used to launch the
	TurboVNC Viewer-- ''/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer'' on Mac/Linux/Un*x
	systems or ''c:\\Program Files\\TurboVNC\\vncviewer-java.bat'' if running
	the Java TurboVNC Viewer on Windows systems.

''-tunnel'' can be used as a shortcut whenever the SSH and VNC servers are the
same machine.  ''-via'' is more flexible, since it allows you to specify the
VNC server to which to connect.  The VNC server is specified from the point of
view of the SSH server, which is why we used ''localhost'' in the above
example.

The command used to establish the SSH tunnel is configurable by way of
environment variables.  See {ref prefix="Section ": VNC_VIA_CMD} for more
details.

	!!! NOTE: In this release of TurboVNC, the TurboVNC Viewer for Linux/Un*x
	and Mac platforms is actually the Java TurboVNC Viewer, which is packaged
	along with the libjpeg-turbo JNI library and necessary glueware to make the
	viewer behave and perform like a standalone native viewer.  Since the Java
	TurboVNC Viewer contains an embedded SSH client, the ''via'' and
	''tunnel'' parameters can also be used when the viewer is deployed using Java
	Web Start.

	!!! The Windows TurboVNC Viewer contains experimental support for the
	''-via'' and ''-tunnel'' command-line options.  Currently the use of these
	requires Cygwin or MSYS2, since those are the only known Windows SSH
	implementations that support detaching the SSH process once the tunnel has
	been established.  When using ''-via'' or ''-tunnel'', it is recommended that
	you use the console version of the Windows TurboVNC Viewer (cvncviewer.exe)
	rather than vncviewer.exe.  Otherwise, a new console window will pop up and
	remain for the duration of the VNC connection.  If using MSYS2, or if your
	Cygwin installation resides in a directory other than ''c:\\cygwin'', then
	set the ''VNC_VIA_CMD'' and ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' environment variables
	appropriately (refer to {ref prefix="Section ": VNC_VIA_CMD}.)

*** Forcing Secure Connections
#OPT: noList! plain!

Passing an argument of ''-localhost'' to ''vncserver'' will force the TurboVNC
Server session to accept inbound connections only from the server machine.
This effectively forces SSH tunneling to be used for remote connections.  If
the ''no-remote-connections'' directive is set in the TurboVNC security
configuration file, then that has the effect of enabling the ''-localhost''
option for all new TurboVNC sessions that are started on the machine.

Passing an argument of ''-noreverse'' to ''vncserver'' will disable the ability
to make outbound (reverse) connections from the TurboVNC Server session.
If the ''no-reverse-connections'' directive is set in the TurboVNC
security configuration file, then that has the effect of enabling the
''-noreverse'' option for all new TurboVNC sessions that are started on
the machine.

** Running OpenGL Applications

The TurboVNC Server includes a software GLX/OpenGL implementation that can be
used for casual 3D rendering.  This implementation uses the swrast DRI driver
provided by Mesa 8.x and later.  On systems that do not have vendor-specific
GPU drivers installed, or on systems that provide a libglvnd-enabled build of
Mesa, TurboVNC's software OpenGL implementation can use direct rendering.
Otherwise, it falls back to indirect rendering, which is limited to the OpenGL
1.4 API and which may perform sluggishly (particularly with continuous mouse
input.)  In general, if the server machine has a GPU, then you should use
[[#VGL][VirtualGL]] rather than relying on TurboVNC's software OpenGL
implementation.

Passing ''-extension GLX'' to ''vncserver'' disables the built-in GLX/OpenGL
implementation, thus restoring the behavior of TurboVNC 2.1.x and earlier
(which required VirtualGL in order to run OpenGL applications.)  Passing
''-iglx'' to ''vncserver'' disables indirect rendering.  If the built-in
GLX/OpenGL implementation is not functioning properly, then pass ''-verbose''
to ''vncserver'' to log informational messages that may reveal the source of
the problem.
