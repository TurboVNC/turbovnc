| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_ALRALL = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/Enable automatic lossless refresh for regions that were \
drawn using X11 functions other than ''X[Shm]PutImage()'' |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": ALR}

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_ALRCOPYRECT = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/Enable automatic lossless refresh for regions that were \
drawn using CopyRect |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": ALR}

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_COMBINERECT = __{c}__} |
| Summary | Combine framebuffer updates with more than __''{c}''__ rectangles \
into a single rectangle spanning the bounding box of all of the constituent \
rectangles |
| Default Value | ''100'' |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Applications can sometimes draw many thousands of points or
	tiny lines using individual X11 calls, and this can cause the VNC server to
	send many thousands of tiny rectangles to the VNC viewer.  The overhead
	associated with this can bog down the viewer, and in extreme cases, the
	number of rectangles may even exceed the maximum number that is allowed in a
	single framebuffer update (65534.)  Thus, if a framebuffer update contains
	more than __''{c}''__ rectangles, TurboVNC will coalesce it into a single
	rectangle that covers all of the rectangles in the update.  For applications
	that generate many tiny rectangles, increasing ''TVNC_COMBINERECT'' may
	significantly increase the number of pixels sent to the viewer, which will
	increase network usage.  However, for those same applications, lowering
	''TVNC_COMBINERECT'' will increase the number of rectangles sent to the
	viewer, which will increase the CPU usage of both the server and the viewer.

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_ICEBLOCKSIZE = __{s}__} |
| Summary | Set the block size for the interframe comparison engine (ICE) to \
__''{s}''__ x __''{s}''__ pixels.  Setting __''{s}''__ to 0 causes the ICE to \
compare full rectangles, as TurboVNC 1.2.x did. |
| Default Value | ''256'' |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If interframe comparison is enabled (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": InterframeComparison}), then TurboVNC will compare
	each rectangle of each framebuffer update on a block-by-block basis and send
	only the blocks that have changed.  This prevents large rectangles from being
	re-transmitted if only a few pixels in the rectangle have changed.  Using
	smaller block sizes can decrease network usage if only a few pixels are
	changing between updates, but using smaller block sizes can also interfere
	with the Tight encoder's ability to efficiently split rectangles into
	subrectangles, thus increasing host CPU usage (and sometimes increasing
	network usage as well, which runs counter to the purpose of interframe
	comparison.)  Setting the block size to 0 causes the ICE to compare full
	framebuffer update rectangles, as TurboVNC 1.2.x did.
	{nl}{nl}
	The default block size of 256x256 was chosen based on extensive low-level
	experiments using the same set of RFB session captures that were used when
	designing the TurboVNC encoder.  For most of those datasets, 256x256 blocks
	produced the lowest network and CPU usage, but actual mileage may vary.
	There were rare cases in which using 64x64 blocks or full-rectangle
	comparison produced better network and CPU usage.

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_ICEDEBUG = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/Enable the ICE debugger |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If interframe comparison is enabled (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": InterframeComparison}), then setting this environment
	variable to 1 will cause the interframe comparison engine (ICE) to change the
	color of duplicate screen regions without culling them from the update stream.
	This allows you to easily see which applications are generating duplicate
	updates.

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_MT = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/Enable multithreaded image encoding |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_NTHREADS = __{n}__} |
| Summary | Use __''{n}''__ threads (1 <\= __''{n}''__ <\= 8) to perform image \
	encoding |
| Default Value | __''{n}''__ = the number of CPU cores in the system, up to \
	a maximum of 4 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_PROFILE = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then the TurboVNC Server will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipeline to the Xvnc log file.

** Viewer Settings

Java system properties are normally specified as command-line arguments to the
Java executable.  For example:

	#Pverb: <<---
	java -Dmy.system.property=__value__ -jar MyClass.jar
	---

However, since TurboVNC hides the Java command line inside of its startup
scripts (or inside of an application bundle on macOS), the easiest way to
set these properties is by using the ''JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS'' environment
variable, which allows you to specify Java command-line arguments even if
you don't have access to the command line.  For instance, on Linux you could
execute:

	#Verb: <<---
	JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dturbovnc.profile=1 /opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
	---

to start the TurboVNC Viewer without JPEG acceleration.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.forcealpha = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable back buffer alpha channel |
| Default Value | Enabled if using OpenGL Java 2D blitting, disabled otherwise |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If this property is enabled, then the TurboVNC Viewer will use
	a TYPE_INT_ARGB_PRE (BGRA with pre-computed alpha channel) BufferedImage as
	its back buffer instead of a TYPE_INT_RGB (BGRX) BufferedImage.  When using
	OpenGL blitting in Java 2D (normally accomplished by passing an argument of
	''-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true'' to ''java''), it is generally faster to draw an
	alpha-enabled BufferedImage to the screen, because otherwise glDrawPixels()
	has to set all of the alpha values itself (which can cause it to revert to an
	unaccelerated code path in some cases.)

	!!! NOTE: this property is enabled by default when using Java 7 or later on
	Mac platforms, because OpenGL Java 2D blitting is the only option available.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.lionfs = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable the use of the macOS full-screen application \
	feature |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When running in full-screen mode, the TurboVNC Viewer will
	normally try to take advantage of the full-screen application feature
	provided by OS X/macOS 10.7 and later, if available.  Disabling this property
	will force the viewer to use its own built-in cross-platform
	"pseudo-full-screen" feature instead.  This is useful mainly for testing.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.primary = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable the use of the X11 PRIMARY clipboard selection |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: X11 has two ways of copying/pasting text.  When text is
	selected in most X11 applications, it is copied to the PRIMARY selection,
	and it can be pasted by pressing the middle mouse button.  When text is
	explicitly copied using a "Copy" menu option or a hotkey (such as CTRL-C), it
	is copied to the CLIPBOARD selection, and it can only be pasted by explicitly
	selecting a "Paste" menu option or pressing a hotkey (such as CTRL-V.)
	Normally, on X11 platforms, the TurboVNC Viewer transfers the PRIMARY
	selection from client to server and, when receiving a clipboard update from
	the server, it sets both the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections with the
	server's clipboard contents.  Disabling this property will cause only the
	the CLIPBOARD selection to be transferred from client to server (in other
	words, the clipboard will not be transferred unless you explicitly copy
	something by using a menu option or hotkey), and clipboard changes from the
	server will only affect the client's CLIPBOARD selection (in other words, you
	will have to explicitly paste the server's clipboard contents by using a menu
	option or hotkey on the client.)

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_PROFILE = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then the TurboVNC Viewer will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipeline to the console.

{anchor: TVNC_SERVERARGS}
| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_SERVERARGS'' |
| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.serverargs'' |
| Summary | Additional arguments that the TurboVNC Session Manager will pass \
	to ''vncserver'' when starting a new TurboVNC session \
|
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The TurboVNC Session Manager will pass these command-line
	arguments to the ''vncserver'' script when starting a new TurboVNC session on
	the TurboVNC host.  This can be used, for instance, to enable
	[[#ALR][automatic lossless refresh]].

{anchor: TVNC_SERVERDIR}
| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_SERVERDIR'' |
| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.serverdir'' |
| Summary | The directory in which the TurboVNC Server is installed on the \
	TurboVNC host |
| Default Value | ''/opt/TurboVNC'' |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The TurboVNC Session Manager will execute ''bin/vncserver''
	and ''bin/vncpasswd'' from this directory on the TurboVNC host.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.sessmgr = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable the TurboVNC Session Manager |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Disabling this property will completely disable the TurboVNC
	Session Manager.

| Environment Variable | {pcode: TVNC_SINGLESCREEN = __0 \| 1__} |
| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.singlescreen = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable forcing a single-screen layout when using \
	automatic desktop resizing |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The default behavior of the TurboVNC Viewer, when automatic
	desktop resizing is enabled, is to request a desktop size from the server
	that will fit within the viewer window without using scrollbars, and (if
	multi-screen spanning is enabled) to request a screen layout from the server
	that will align the server's screen boundaries with the client's when the
	viewer window is in its default position.  Setting this environment variable
	or property to 1 will restore the automatic desktop resizing behavior of
	previous versions of the TurboVNC Viewer, thus forcing the server to use a
	single-screen layout even if it supports multi-screen layouts.

| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.sshauth'' |
| Summary | Preferred authentication methods for the built-in SSH client |
| Default Value | ''publickey,keyboard-interactive,password'' |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: This system property can be used to enable or disable
	particular SSH authentication methods, as well as to specify their preferred
	order.  The same thing can be accomplished by using the
	''PreferredAuthentications'' directive in the OpenSSH config file.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.sshbannerdlg = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Display the banner message from the SSH server in a dialog box |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The default behavior of the TurboVNC Viewer is to display the
	banner message from the SSH server on the command line.  Enabling this system
	property causes the viewer to display the banner message in a dialog box
	instead.

| Java System Property | {pcode: turbovnc.swingdb = __0 \| 1__} |
| Summary | Disable/enable Swing double buffering |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The TurboVNC Viewer has its own double buffering mechanism, so
	it normally disables the double buffering mechanism in Swing and Java 2D in
	order to increase performance.  This also allows the viewer to achieve
	optimal performance under X11 without requiring MIT-SHM pixmap support.
	Although the viewer has been thoroughly tested, the ''turbovnc.swingdb''
	system property is provided as a fallback in case issues are discovered when
	running it under a specific version of Java.

{anchor: VNC_VIA_CMD}
| Environment Variable | ''VNC_VIA_CMD'', ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' |
| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.via'', ''turbovnc.tunnel'' |
| Summary | SSH command-line templates for use with the ''via'' and \
	''tunnel'' options (respectively) |
| Default Value | See below |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When the ''-via'' option is used along with the ''-extssh''
	option, the TurboVNC Viewer reads the ''VNC_VIA_CMD'' environment variable or
	the ''turbovnc.via'' system property, expands patterns beginning with the "%"
	character, and uses the resulting command line to establish the secure tunnel
	to the VNC gateway.  If ''VNC_VIA_CMD'' and ''turbovnc.via'' are not set,
	then this command-line template defaults to one of the following values:
	{nl}{nl}
	|| System Type || Connection Type || \
		Default ''VNC_VIA_CMD''/''turbovnc.via'' Value ||
	| Linux/Un*x and Mac | TCP port | \
		''/usr/bin/env ssh -axf -L %L:%H:%R %G sleep 20'' |
	| Windows | TCP port | \
		''ssh.exe -axf -L %L:%H:%R %G sleep 20'' |
	| Linux/Un*x and Mac | Unix domain socket | \
		''/usr/bin/env ssh -ax -J %G -- %H exec socat stdio unix-connect:%R'' |
	| Windows | Unix domain socket | \
		''ssh.exe -ax -J %G -- %H exec socat stdio unix-connect:%R'' |
	{nl} \
	When the ''-tunnel'' option is used along with the ''-extssh'' option, the
	TurboVNC Viewer reads the ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' environment variable or the
	''turbovnc.tunnel'' system property, expands patterns beginning with the "%"
	character, and uses the resulting command line to establish the secure tunnel
	to the VNC host.  If ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' and ''turbovnc.tunnel'' are not set,
	then this command-line template defaults to one of the following values:
	{nl}{nl}
	|| System Type || Connection Type || \
		Default ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD''/''turbovnc.tunnel'' Value ||
	| Linux/Un*x and Mac | TCP port | \
		''/usr/bin/env ssh -axf -L %L:localhost:%R %H sleep 20'' |
	| Windows | TCP port | \
		''ssh.exe -axf -L %L:localhost:%R %H sleep 20'' |
	| Linux/Un*x and Mac | Unix domain socket | \
		''/usr/bin/env ssh -ax -- %H exec socat stdio unix-connect:%R'' |
	| Windows | Unix domain socket | \
		''ssh.exe -ax -- %H exec socat stdio unix-connect:%R'' |
	{nl} \
	The following patterns are recognized in the ''VNC_VIA_CMD'' and
	''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' environment variables and their corresponding system
	properties.  Note that ''%H'' and ''%R'' must be present in the command-line
	template, and ''%G'' must also be present if using the ''-via'' option.  If
	the VNC server is listening on a TCP port, then ''%L'' must also be present.
	If the VNC server is listening on a Unix domain socket, then ''%L'' can
	optionally be used to forward a local TCP port to the remote Unix domain
	socket (for instance, by setting ''VNC_TUNNEL_CMD'' to
	''/usr/bin/env ssh -axf -L %L:%R %H sleep 20''.)  If ''%L'' is not present,
	then the TurboVNC Viewer expects the SSH command line to connect standard
	input and standard output to the remote Unix domain socket.
	{nl}{nl}
	| ''%%'' | A literal "%" |
	| ''%G'' | gateway host name or IP address |
	| ''%H'' | remote VNC host name or IP address (if using the ''-via'' \
		option, then this is specified from the point of view of the gateway) |
	| ''%L'' | local TCP port number |
	| ''%R'' | remote TCP port number or the escaped name of a Unix domain \
		socket on the VNC host |
