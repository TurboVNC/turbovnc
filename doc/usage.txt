** The TurboVNC Session Manager
{anchor: TurboVNC_Session_Manager}

The TurboVNC Viewer, like any VNC viewer, can be used to connect to any VNC
server.  However, the TurboVNC Viewer also includes the TurboVNC Session
Manager, which can be used with the TurboVNC Server to remotely start or kill a
TurboVNC session, list all TurboVNC sessions running under a particular user
account on a particular host, and choose a TurboVNC session to which to
connect.  The TurboVNC Session Manager uses the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH
client, which supports OpenSSH config files and password-less public key
authentication (using ssh-agent or Pageant.)

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* On the client machine, start the TurboVNC Viewer.

		Linux/Un*x clients :: {:}
		Open a new terminal/xterm and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Mac clients :: {:}
		Open the {file: TurboVNC Viewer} application, located in the
		{file: TurboVNC} Applications folder, or open a new terminal and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		Select {file: TurboVNC Viewer} in the {file: TurboVNC} Start Menu group, or
		open a new command prompt and type
		#Verb: <<---
		c:\Program Files\TurboVNC\vncviewer.bat
		---

	* A small dialog box will appear.
		{nl}{nl}
		{img:newconn-sessmgr.png}
		{nl}{nl}
		Enter the hostname or IP address of the TurboVNC host in the "VNC server"
		field, then click "Connect".
		{nl}{nl}

	* The TurboVNC Session Manager will connect to the host using SSH, and it
		will prompt for an SSH private key passphrase or an SSH password, if
		necessary.  (The TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client will first try to
		fetch the private key passphrase from ssh-agent or Pageant, if either is
		running.)

		!!! You can specify the SSH username, if it differs from your local
		username, by prefixing the hostname/IP address with {pcode: __user__@},
		where __''user''__ is the SSH username.

	* If no TurboVNC sessions are currently running under your user account on
		the TurboVNC host, then the session manager will:
		{nl}{nl}
		* start a new session
		* generate a new one-time password (OTP) for the session
		* automatically configure the TurboVNC Viewer so that it tunnels the VNC
			connection through SSH (reusing the SSH channel that the session
			manager already opened) and authenticates with the newly-generated OTP
		* connect to the session

	Once connected, a TurboVNC desktop window should appear on your client
	machine.  This window contains a virtual desktop with which you can
	interact to launch X-Windows applications on the TurboVNC host.
	{nl}{nl}

	* If one or more TurboVNC sessions are currently running under your user
		account on the TurboVNC host, then the session manager will enumerate the
		sessions and display a dialog similar to the following, allowing you to
		manage the sessions remotely, to start a new session, or to choose a
		session to which to connect:
		{nl}{nl}
		{img:sessmgr.png}
		{nl}{nl}
		Upon choosing a session to which to connect, the session manager will (as
		described above) automatically generate a new OTP for the session and
		configure the TurboVNC Viewer so that it tunnels the VNC connection through
		SSH and authenticates with the newly-generated OTP.
		{nl}{nl}
		One-time passwords can be used with any VNC viewer, so generating a new OTP
		for a TurboVNC session (using the "New OTP" button) is a convenient way of
		allowing colleagues to temporarily access the session.  Generating a new
		OTP for a TurboVNC session is also useful when using [[#noVNC][noVNC]].  If
		"View-only" is checked, then users who authenticate with the new OTP will
		not be able to remotely control the session.

	!!! The TurboVNC Session Manager automatically uses SSH tunneling and OTP
	authentication by default, but you can pass ''-nosessmgrauto'' on the
	TurboVNC Viewer command line to disable this behavior, thus allowing any
	authentication/encryption method to be used.  Additional command-line
	parameters can be used to specify the port on which the SSH server is
	listening and the location of the SSH private key file.  The OpenSSH config
	file ({file: ~/.ssh/config} by default) can also be used to specify those
	parameters persistently for a given host.

	!!! The ''TVNC_SERVERDIR'' and ''TVNC_SERVERARGS'' environment variables, and
	their equivalent Java system properties (''turbovnc.serverdir'' and
	''turbovnc.serverargs'') can be used to specify a non-default installation
	path for the TurboVNC Server or additional arguments to pass to the TurboVNC
	Server when starting new sessions (refer to
	{ref prefix="Section " : TVNC_SERVERARGS}.)  These arguments can also be
	specified on the server using the system-wide or per-user
	{file: turbovncserver.conf} file.

** Manually Starting a TurboVNC Session

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window on your client machine.

	#. In the new Command Prompt/terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSH)
		session into the TurboVNC host:

		#Pverb: <<---
		ssh __user__@__host__
		---

		Replace __''user''__ with your username on the TurboVNC host and
		__''host''__ with the hostname or IP address of the host.

	#. In the SSH session, start a TurboVNC session:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver
		---

	#. Make a note of the X display number that the TurboVNC session is
		occupying, for instance:
		{nl}{nl}
		''Desktop 'TurboVNC: my_host:1 (my_user)' started on display my_host:1''
		{nl}{nl}
		If this is the first time that a TurboVNC session has ever been run
		under this user account, and if VNC password authentication is enabled for
		the session, then TurboVNC will prompt for a VNC password.

	#. The SSH session can now be exited, if desired.

** Manually Connecting to a VNC Server

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. On the client machine, start the TurboVNC Viewer.

		Linux/Un*x clients :: {:}
		Open a new terminal/xterm and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Mac clients :: {:}
		Open the {file: TurboVNC Viewer} application, located in the
		{file: TurboVNC} Applications folder, or open a new terminal and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		Select {file: TurboVNC Viewer} in the {file: TurboVNC} Start Menu group, or
		open a new command prompt and type
		#Verb: <<---
		c:\Program Files\TurboVNC\vncviewer.bat
		---

	#. A small dialog box will appear.
		{nl}{nl}
		{img:newconn.png}
		{nl}{nl}
		Enter the X display name (hostname, or IP address, and display number) of
		the VNC server or TurboVNC session in the "VNC server" field, then click
		"Connect".

	#. Another dialog box appears, prompting for the password (if Standard
		VNC authentication is being used) or for the username and password (if
		Unix Login authentication is being used.)
		{nl}{nl}
		| Standard VNC Authentication Dialog | {img:vncauth.png} |
		| Unix Login Authentication Dialog   | {img:unixauth.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the VNC server password or the Unix username/password and press
		Enter.
		{nl}{nl}
		A VNC desktop window should appear on your client machine.  This
		window contains a virtual desktop with which you can interact to launch
		graphical applications on the VNC host.

	!!! If you are connecting to a non-VeNCrypt-compatible VNC server, then
	the authentication dialog will warn you that the connection is not
	encrypted:
	{nl}{nl}
	{img:vncauth-insecure.png}
	{nl}{nl}
	You should never use Unix Login authentication with an unencrypted
	connection.  Instead, tunnel the connection through SSH (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": Secure_TurboVNC_Usage} below for more details.)

** Disconnecting and Killing a TurboVNC Session

Closing the TurboVNC Viewer disconnects from the TurboVNC session, but the
TurboVNC session will remain running on the TurboVNC host (as will any
applications that you may have started within the session), and you can
reconnect to the session at any time.

If the TurboVNC session was created with default settings, then the easiest way
to kill it is to log out of the window manager running in the session.  You can
also use the [[#TurboVNC_Session_Manager][TurboVNC Session Manager]] to
remotely kill TurboVNC sessions, or you can type the following command:

		#Pverb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :__n__
		---

from a terminal in the TurboVNC session or from an SSH session on the host.
Replace __''n''__ with the X display number of the TurboVNC session you want
to kill.

To list the X display numbers and process ID's of all TurboVNC sessions
currently running under your user account on a particular host, type the
following command:

	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list
	---

from a terminal in the TurboVNC session or from an SSH session on the host.

** Using TurboVNC in a Web Browser
{anchor: noVNC}

When a TurboVNC session is started, the ''vncserver'' script can optionally
start a simple web server that serves up [[https://novnc.com][noVNC]], an
HTML 5/JavaScript VNC viewer that works in any web browser (with reduced
performance and features relative to the TurboVNC Viewer.)  This allows you to
easily connect to a TurboVNC session from a machine that does not have the
TurboVNC Viewer installed (including mobile devices.)

To launch noVNC along with a TurboVNC session, pass
{pcode: -novnc __dir__} to ''/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver'' when starting
the session, where __''dir''__ is the directory containing noVNC (setting the
''$noVNC'' variable in {file: turbovncserver.conf} has the same effect.)  The
''vncserver'' script will print the noVNC URL, which will be of the form:

#Pverb: <<---
{plain: http://}__host__:__5800+n__/vnc.html?host=__host__&port=__5900+n__
---

or

#Pverb: <<---
{plain: https://}__host__:__5800+n__/vnc.html?host=__host__&port=__5900+n__&encrypt=1
---

where __''host''__ is the hostname or IP address of the TurboVNC host, and
__''n''__ is the X display number of the TurboVNC session.

Point your web browser to that URL in order to access the TurboVNC session.
You can optionally pass
{pcode: -x509cert __certificate-file__ -x509key __private-key-file__} to
''vncserver'' to encrypt both the HTTP and RFB connections.  See the
''vncserver'' man page for more details.

	!!! NOTE: noVNC only supports VNC Password authentication, so it is strongly
	recommended that it be used only with one-time passwords unless the
	connections are encrypted.

** Using SSH to Manually Secure a TurboVNC Connection
{anchor: Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}

If the [[#TurboVNC_Session_Manager][TurboVNC Session Manager]] is not being
used, then the connection between the TurboVNC Server and the TurboVNC Viewer
will, by default, use Anonymous TLS encryption (refer to
{ref prefix="Chapter ": Security_Extensions}.)  However, it may be preferable
to secure the TurboVNC connection using SSH rather than Anonymous TLS
encryption, particularly if one does not want to open additional ports in the
host's firewall.  This can easily be accomplished by using the ''-via'' and
''-tunnel'' command-line options in the TurboVNC Viewer (or the equivalent GUI
options, which are located under the "Security" tab in the Options dialog.)

The ''-via'' and ''-tunnel'' options in the TurboVNC Viewer take advantage of
the port forwarding feature in SSH.  For instance, running

	#Pverb: <<---
	__vncviewer__ -via __user__@__host__ localhost:__n__
	---

or

	#Pverb: <<---
	__vncviewer__ -tunnel __user__@__host__:__n__
	---

is the equivalent of running

	#Pverb: <<---
	ssh -L __fp__:localhost:__5900+n__ __user__@__host__
	__vncviewer__ localhost::__fp__
	---

where __''fp''__ is a free TCP port on the client machine (this is
automatically determined by the TurboVNC Viewer.)

	!!! In the above examples, __''vncviewer''__ is the command used to launch
	the TurboVNC Viewer-- ''/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer'' on Mac/Linux/Un*x
	systems or ''c:\\Program Files\\TurboVNC\\vncviewer.bat'' on Windows systems.

''-tunnel'' can be used as a shortcut whenever the SSH and VNC hosts are the
same machine.  ''-via'' is more flexible, since it allows you to specify the
VNC server to which to connect.  The VNC server is specified from the point of
view of the SSH server, which is why we used ''localhost'' in the above
example.

The command used to establish the SSH tunnel is configurable by way of
environment variables.  See {ref prefix="Section ": VNC_VIA_CMD} for more
details.

*** Forcing SSH Connections
#OPT: noList! plain!

Passing an argument of ''-localhost'' to ''vncserver'' will force the TurboVNC
session to accept inbound connections only from the TurboVNC host.  This
effectively forces SSH tunneling to be used for remote connections.  If the
''no-remote-connections'' directive is set in the TurboVNC security
configuration file, then that has the effect of enabling the ''-localhost''
option for all new TurboVNC sessions that are started on the host.

Passing an argument of ''-noreverse'' to ''vncserver'' will disable the ability
to make outbound (reverse) connections from the TurboVNC session.  If the
''no-reverse-connections'' directive is set in the TurboVNC security
configuration file, then that has the effect of enabling the ''-noreverse''
option for all new TurboVNC sessions that are started on the host.

If the host is configured such that it only allows SSH connections, then
disallowing the TLS* security types on a system-wide basis (by setting the
''permitted-security-types'' directive in the TurboVNC security configuration
file) is recommended.  Otherwise, when using the TurboVNC Viewer with default
settings, the connection will have redundant encryption.

** Running OpenGL Applications

The TurboVNC Server includes a software GLX/OpenGL implementation that can be
used for casual 3D rendering.  This implementation uses the swrast DRI driver
provided by Mesa 8.x and later, and it supports only direct rendering.  Thus,
it can only be used on systems that do not have vendor-specific GPU drivers
installed or on systems that provide a libglvnd-enabled build of Mesa.  In
general, if the TurboVNC host has a GPU, then you should use
[[#VGL][VirtualGL]] rather than relying on TurboVNC's software OpenGL
implementation.

Passing ''-extension GLX'' to ''vncserver'' disables the built-in GLX/OpenGL
implementation, thus restoring the behavior of TurboVNC 2.1.x and earlier
(which required VirtualGL in order to run OpenGL applications.)  If the
built-in GLX/OpenGL implementation is not functioning properly, then pass
''-verbose'' to ''vncserver'' to log informational messages that may reveal the
source of the problem.

** Window Manager Compatibility

This version of the TurboVNC Server can run 3D (compositing) window managers
(such as Unity or GNOME 3+ or KDE 5+) using its built-in software OpenGL
implementation, and it also provides an option (''-vgl'') that allows for
running 3D window managers using VirtualGL.  However, for performance reasons,
it is generally recommended that you use a 2D window manager with the TurboVNC
Server (even with VirtualGL, 3D window managers have a lot of overhead.)  As of
this writing, Ubuntu, RHEL 7+, and Fedora provide an optional 2D window manager
called "GNOME Fallback", "GNOME Flashback", or "GNOME Classic", which will
automatically be used if it is installed and the ''TVNC_WM'' environment
variable is set to ''2d''.  For other systems that lack a 2D window manager, it
is recommended that you install MATE or Xfce.  Refer to
[[http://www.turbovnc.org/Documentation/Compatibility30][this report]] for an
up-to-date list of window managers that have been tested with this version of
the TurboVNC Server, how to configure the TurboVNC Server to use those window
managers, and a list of known compatibility issues.
