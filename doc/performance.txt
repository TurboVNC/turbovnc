* Performance and Image Quality

The level of image compression in TurboVNC can be adjusted to balance the
(sometimes conflicting) goals of high image quality and high performance.
There are four options that control the manner in which TurboVNC compresses
images:

	Allow JPEG compression :: {:}
		If this option is enabled, then TurboVNC will use JPEG compression for
		subrectangles that have a high number of unique colors, and it will use
		indexed color subencoding for subrectangles that have a low number of
		unique colors.  If this option is disabled, then TurboVNC will select
		between indexed color or raw subencoding, depending on the size of the
		subrectangle and its color count.

	JPEG image quality :: {:}
		Lower quality levels produce grainier JPEG images with more noticeable
		compression artifacts, but lower quality levels also use less network
		bandwidth and CPU time.

	JPEG chrominance subsampling :: {:}
		When compressing an image using JPEG, the RGB pixels are first converted to
		the YCbCr colorspace, a colorspace in which each pixel is represented as a
		brightness (Y, or "luminance") value and a pair of color (Cb & Cr, or
		"chrominance") values.  After this colorspace conversion, chrominance
		subsampling can be used to discard some of the chrominance components in
		order to save bandwidth.  This works because the human eye is more
		sensitive to changes in brightness than to changes in color.  1X
		subsampling (the default in TurboVNC) retains the chrominance components
		for all pixels, and thus it provides the best image quality but also uses
		the most network bandwidth and CPU time.  2X subsampling retains the
		chrominance components for every other pixel, and 4X subsampling retains
		the chrominance components for every fourth pixel (this is typically
		implemented as 2X subsampling in both X and Y directions.)  Grayscale
		throws out all of the chrominance components, leaving only luminance.  2X
		and 4X subsampling will typically produce noticeable blurring of lines and
		other sharp features, but with photographic or other "smooth" image
		content, it may be difficult to detect any difference between 1X, 2X, and
		4X.

	Compression level :: {:}
		In TurboVNC, the compression level specifies:
		{list type=ol:
			{item: the level of zlib compression that will be used with indexed
				color, mono, and raw subrectangles}
			{item: the "palette threshold" (the minimum number of colors that a
				subrectangle must have before it is encoded as JPEG or raw instead of
				indexed color)}
			{item: whether or not [[#InterframeComparison][interframe comparison]]
				should be used}
		}
		See {ref prefix="Section ": AdvancedCompression} below for more details.

These parameters can be adjusted by accessing the TurboVNC Viewer Options
dialog box (click on the "Options" button in the "TurboVNC Connection" dialog
box or, after connecting to the server, click on the Connection Options button
in the toolbar.)

The TurboVNC Viewer provides five preset "encoding methods", corresponding
to the most useful combinations of the image compression options described
above:

|| Encoding method || Allow JPEG || JPEG image quality || \
	JPEG chrominance subsampling || Compression level || Notes ||
| "Tight + Perceptually Lossless JPEG" | Yes | 95 | 1x | 1 | \
	This encoding method should be perceptually lossless (that is, any image \
	compression artifacts it produces should be imperceptible to human vision) \
	under most viewing conditions.  This encoding method requires a great \
	deal of network bandwidth, however, and is generally not recommended except \
	on 50 Megabit/second and faster networks. |
| "Tight + Medium-Quality JPEG" | Yes | 80 | 2x | 6 | \
	For subrectangles that have a high number of unique colors, this encoding method \
	produces some minor, but generally not very noticeable, image compression \
	artifacts.  All else being equal, this encoding method typically uses about \
	twice the network bandwidth of the "Tight + Low-Quality JPEG" encoding \
	method and about half the bandwidth of the "Tight + Perceptually Lossless \
	JPEG" encoding method, making it appropriate for medium-speed networks such \
	as 10 Megabit Ethernet.  Interframe comparison is enabled with this \
	encoding method (Compression Level 6 = Compression Level 1 + interframe \
	comparison.) |
| "Tight + Low-Quality JPEG" | Yes | 30 | 4x | 7 | \
	For subrectangles that have a high number of unique colors, this encoding method \
	produces very noticeable image compression artifacts.  However, it performs \
	optimally on low-bandwidth connections.  If image quality is more critical \
	than performance, then use one of the other encoding methods or take \
	advantage of the [[#LR][Lossless Refresh feature]].  In addition to \
	reducing the JPEG quality to a "minimum usable" level, this encoding method \
	also enables interframe comparison and Compression Level 2 (CL 7 = CL 2 + \
	interframe comparison.)  Compression Level 2 can reduce bandwidth for \
	low-color application workloads that are not good candidates for JPEG \
	compression. |
| "Lossless Tight" | No | N/A | N/A | 0 | \
	This encoding method uses indexed color subencoding for subrectangles that have \
	a low number of unique colors, but it otherwise does not perform any image \
	compression at all.  Lossless Tight is thus suitable only for gigabit and faster \
	networks.  This encoding method uses significantly less CPU time than any \
	of the JPEG-based encoding methods.  Lossless Tight requires an RFB \
	protocol extension that is, as of this writing, only supported by the \
	TurboVNC Viewer. |
| "Lossless Tight + Zlib" | No | N/A | N/A | 6 | \
	This encoding method uses indexed color subencoding for subrectangles that have \
	a low number of unique colors and raw subencoding for subrectangles that have a \
	high number of unique colors.  It compresses all subrectangles using zlib \
	with zlib compression level 1.  For certain types of low-color workloads (CAD \
	applications, in particular), this encoding method may use less network \
	bandwidth than the "Tight + Perceptually Lossless JPEG" encoding method, \
	but it also uses significantly more CPU time than any of the JPEG-based \
	encoding methods.  Interframe comparison is enabled with this encoding \
	method (Compression Level 6 = Compression Level 1 + interframe \
	comparison.) |
#CAP: TurboVNC Encoding Methods

The encoding method can be set in the TurboVNC Viewer Options dialog box (click
on the "Options" button in the "TurboVNC Connection" dialog box or, after
connecting to the server, click on the Connection Options button in the
toolbar.)

** Interframe Comparison
{anchor: InterframeComparison}

Certain ill-behaved applications can sometimes draw the same thing over and
over again, and this can cause redundant framebuffer updates to be sent to the
VNC viewer.  Additionally, modern GUI toolkits often use image-based drawing
methods (the X Rendering Extension, for instance), which can result in an
entire window being redrawn, even if only a few pixels in the window have
changed.  The TurboVNC Server can guard against this by maintaining a copy of
the remote framebuffer for each connected viewer, comparing each new
framebuffer update rectangle against the pixels in the framebuffer copy, and
discarding any redundant portions of the rectangle before they are sent to the
viewer.

Interframe comparison has some tradeoffs associated with it.  Perhaps the most
important of these is that it increases the memory usage of the TurboVNC Server
by a factor of N, where N is the number of connected viewers.  This can prove
to be quite significant if the remote desktop size is relatively large.

2D applications are most often the ones that generate duplicate framebuffer
updates, so using interframe comparison with such applications can
significantly reduce the network usage and the host CPU usage (since fewer
rectangles are actually being encoded.)  However, with 3D applications, the
benefits of interframe comparison are less clear, since it is less common for
those applications to generate duplicate framebuffer updates.  Interframe
comparison may benefit certain classes of 3D applications, such as design
applications that render a model against a static background-- particularly
when the model is not zoomed in enough to fill the entire window.  In
real-world tests, however, interframe comparison rarely reduces the network
usage for 3D applications by more than 5-10%.  Furthermore, with games and
other immersive applications that modify most of the pixels on the screen each
time a frame is rendered, interframe comparison can actually increase both CPU
usage and network usage.  Furthermore, the effects of duplicate framebuffer
updates are not typically noticeable on high-speed networks, but an increase in
host CPU usage might be.

For these reasons, interframe comparison is not enabled by default and should
not generally be enabled except on bandwidth-constrained networks and with
applications for which it can be shown to be beneficial.  Interframe comparison
can be enabled by either passing an argument of ''-interframe'' to
''vncserver'' when starting a TurboVNC session or by requesting a compression
level of 5 or higher from the viewer (see below.)

** Advanced Compression Options
{anchor: AdvancedCompression}

One of the underlying principles of TurboVNC's design is to expose only the
options that have proven to be useful (that is, the options that have proven to
have good performance tradeoffs.)  Thus, the TurboVNC Viewer GUI will normally
only allow you to select Compression Levels 1-2 if JPEG subencoding is enabled
(6-7 if interframe comparison is also enabled) or Compression Levels 0-1 if
JPEG subencoding is disabled (5-6 if interframe comparison is enabled.)  Other
compression levels can, however, be specified on the command line, and doing so
will enable a compatibility mode in the TurboVNC Viewer GUI that allows any
compression level from 0 to 9 to be requested.

When connecting to a TurboVNC server, requesting a particular compression level
has the following effect:

|| Compression level || Zlib compression level (non-JPEG subrectangles) || \
	Palette threshold || Interframe comparison || Notes ||
| 0 | 1 | 24 | No | Same as Compression Level 1.  Bypassing zlib when JPEG is \
	enabled would only reduce the CPU usage for non-JPEG subrectangles, which \
	is of limited usefulness.  Further, bypassing zlib requires an RFB protocol \
	extension that is not supported by non-TurboVNC viewers.  It is presumed \
	that, if one wants to reduce the CPU usage, then one wants to do so for all \
	subrectangles, so CL 0 without JPEG (AKA "Lossless Tight") should be used. |
| 1 | 1 | 24 | No | See the description of the "Tight + JPEG" encoding \
	methods above. |
| 2 | 3 | 96 | No | A higher palette threshold causes indexed color \
	subencoding to be used more often than with CL 1, and indexed color \
	subrectangles are compressed using a higher zlib compression level.  This \
	can provide typically 20-40% better compression than CL 1 (with a \
	commensurate increase in CPU usage) for workloads that have a low number of \
	unique colors.  However, Compression Level 2 can increase the CPU usage \
	for some high-color workloads without providing significantly better \
	compression. |
| 3-4 | 3 | 96 | No | Same as Compression Level 2 (reserved for future expansion) |
| 5-6 | 1 | 24 | Yes | Same as Compression Level 1, but with interframe \
	comparison enabled |
| 7-8 | 3 | 96 | Yes | Same as Compression Level 2, but with interframe \
	comparison enabled |
| 9 | 7 | 256 | Yes | This mode is included only for backward compatibility \
	with TightVNC.  It provides approximately the same level of compression for \
	2D applications as Compression Level 9 in TightVNC 1.3.x, while using much less \
	CPU time.  It also provides much better compression than TightVNC for 3D \
	and video applications.  However, relative to Compression Level 2, this \
	mode uses approximately twice as much CPU time and only achieves about \
	10-20% better average compression for 2D apps (and has no noticeable \
	benefit for 3D and video apps.)  Thus, its usefulness is generally very \
	limited. |

** Lossless Refresh
{anchor: LR}

Since both of TurboVNC's mathematically lossless encoding methods have
performance drawbacks, another option for image-quality-critical applications
is the "Lossless Refresh" feature.  When a lossless refresh is requested by a
TurboVNC viewer, the server will send a mathematically lossless image of the
current TurboVNC desktop to the requesting viewer.  So, for instance, a user
can rotate/pan/zoom an object in their 3D application using a very low-quality
JPEG setting, then when that user is ready to interpret or analyze the object,
they can request a lossless refresh of TurboVNC's virtual screen.

To perform a lossless refresh, press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-L or click on the Lossless
Refresh toolbar icon.

** Automatic Lossless Refresh
{anchor: ALR}

Passing an argument of {pcode: -alr __timeout__} to ''vncserver'' will enable
the automatic lossless refresh (ALR) feature for the TurboVNC session.  ALR
will monitor all of the VNC viewer connections, and if more than
__''timeout''__ seconds have elapsed since the last framebuffer update was sent
to a given viewer, then the TurboVNC Server will send to that viewer a
mathematically lossless copy of any "ALR-eligible" screen regions that have
been affected by lossy compression.  You can also pass arguments of
''-alrqual'' and ''-alrsamp'' to ''vncserver'' to specify that automatic
lossless refreshes should be sent using JPEG instead (see the ''Xvnc'' man page
for details.)

The ALR feature is designed mainly for use with interactive visualization
applications.  The idea is that, on a low-bandwidth connection, low-quality
JPEG can be used while the 3D scene is rotated/panned/zoomed, but when the
motion stops, a fully lossless copy of the 3D image is sent and can be studied
in detail.

The default is for any regions drawn with ''X[Shm]PutImage()'' to be
ALR-eligible, as well as any regions drawn with CopyRect, if the source of the
CopyRect operation was affected by lossy compression (CopyRect is an RFB
encoding that allows the server to request that the viewer move a rectangle of
pixels from one location to another.)  When used with VirtualGL, this means
that ALRs will mainly be sent for just the 3D screen regions.  This should be
fine for most 3D applications, since the 3D regions are the ones that are
quality-critical.  The default ALR behavior also prevents what might best be
called the "blinking cursor dilemma."  Certain programs have a blinking cursor
that may update more frequently than the ALR timeout.  Since an ALR is
triggered based on a period of inactivity relative to the last framebuffer
update, these continuous updates prevent an ALR from ever being sent.
Fortunately, blinking cursors are not typically drawn using
''X[Shm]PutImage()'', so the problem is effectively worked around by limiting
the ALR-eligible regions to just the subset of regions that were drawn with
''X[Shm]PutImage()'' and CopyRect.

	!!! NOTE: Ill-behaved applications that continuously render the same image
	will cause a variation of the "blinking cursor dilemma" and thus defeat ALR
	unless [[#InterframeComparison][interframe comparison]] is enabled.

You can override the default ALR behavior, thus making all screen regions
eligible for ALR, by setting the ''TVNC_ALRALL'' environment variable to ''1''
on the TurboVNC host prior to starting a TurboVNC session.  You can also set
''TVNC_ALRCOPYRECT'' to ''0'' to make CopyRect regions ALR-ineligible, which
approximates the behavior of TurboVNC 1.2.1 and prior.

** Multithreading
{anchor: Multithreading}

By default, the TurboVNC Server uses multiple threads to perform image encoding
and compression, thus allowing it to take advantage of multi-core or
multi-processor systems.  The server splits the screen vertically into N tiles,
where N is the number of threads, and assigns each tile to a separate thread.
The scalability of this algorithm is nearly linear when used with demanding 3D
or video applications that fill most of the screen.  However, whether or not
multithreading improves the overall performance of TurboVNC depends largely on
the performance of the viewer and the network.  If either the viewer or the
network is the primary performance bottleneck, then enabling multithreading in
the server will not help.  Multithreading is also not currently implemented
with non-Tight encoding types.

To disable server-side multithreading, set the ''TVNC_MT'' environment variable
to ''0'' on the host prior to starting ''vncserver'', or pass an argument of
''-nomt'' to ''vncserver''.  The default behavior is to use as many threads as
there are cores on the TurboVNC host (up to a maximum of 4), but you can set
the ''TVNC_NTHREADS'' environment variable or pass an argument of ''-nthreads''
to ''vncserver'' to override this.
