* Conventions Used in This Document

This document assumes that TurboVNC will be installed in the default
directory ({file: /opt/TurboVNC} on Linux/Un*x and Mac systems and
{file: c:\\Program Files\\TurboVNC} on Windows systems.)  If your installation
of TurboVNC resides in a different directory, then adjust the instructions
accordingly.

** Terminology

	VNC server (sometimes just "server") :: A computer program, implementing
	the Remote Framebuffer (RFB) protocol and usually designed to run as a
	background process, that provides an interactive remote desktop environment
	through which authenticated users can run graphical programs remotely from
	other computers on the network.  VNC servers can be implemented as
	single-user screen scrapers, which transmit the contents of the host's
	physical display (most common with Windows and Mac VNC servers), or as
	virtual display servers, which provide isolated remote desktop environments
	for an arbitrary number of simultaneous users on the same host (most common
	with Un*x VNC servers.)

	VNC host (sometimes just "host") :: The machine on which a VNC server is
	running

	VNC viewer (sometimes just "viewer") :: A computer program, implementing
	the Remote Framebuffer (RFB) protocol, that connects to a VNC server running
	on another computer, thus allowing users to run graphical programs remotely.

	client machine (sometimes just "client") :: The machine on which a VNC viewer
	is running

	VNC session (sometimes just "session") :: A specific instance of a Un*x VNC
	server (Xvnc.)  Each instance of an Xvnc server, including the TurboVNC
	Server, acts as an independent virtual X server, listening on a unique X11
	display number for connections from X11 clients and listening on a unique TCP
	port number or Unix domain socket for connections from VNC viewers.  Multiple
	simultaneous VNC sessions can exist on a given host, under any number of
	different user accounts.
