* Obtaining and Installing TurboVNC

** Installing TurboVNC on Linux

*** Font Dependencies
#OPT: noList! plain!

On some Linux distributions, most notably Fedora 10 and later, the basic X11
bitmap fonts are not installed by default.  Thus, it is necessary to install
the ''xorg-x11-fonts-misc'' package on these distributions prior to starting a
TurboVNC session for the first time.  Otherwise, TurboVNC will fail with the
following error:

	#Verb <<---
	Fatal server error:
	could not open default font 'fixed'
	---

*** Installing TurboVNC
#OPT: noList! plain!

	1. Download the appropriate TurboVNC binary package for your system from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].
		Packages are provided for RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions
		that contain GLIBC 2.5 or later (including
		[[http://fedoraproject.org][Fedora]] 6 or later,
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[http://www.centos.org/][CentOS]] \
		5 or later,
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise/[[http://www.opensuse.org][openSUSE]] 11 or later,
		and [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] 8.04 or later.)
		{nl}

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the binary
		package, and issue one of the following commands:

		RPM-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -U turbovnc*.rpm
		---

		Debian-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		dpkg -i turbovnc*.deb
		---

*** Installing TurboVNC for a Single User
#OPT: noList! plain!

Download the appropriate binary package, as above, then execute the following
commands:

	RPM-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	mkdir ~/turbovnc
	cd ~/turbovnc
	rpm2cpio {full path of turbovnc*.rpm} | cpio -idv
	---

	Debian-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	dpkg-deb --extract {full path of turbovnc*.deb} ~/turbovnc
	---

Add __~/turbovnc__ to any paths specified in this document.  Note that the
TurboVNC security configuration file will not work when TurboVNC is installed
in this manner.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on OS X

	#. Download the TurboVNC Mac disk image
		(''TurboVNC-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

		!!! This package requires [[http://www.java.com][Oracle Java]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''TurboVNC.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac TurboVNC Viewer.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on Windows

	#. Download the TurboVNC Windows installer package
		(''TurboVNC-''__''{version}''__''.exe'' for 32-bit systems or
		''TurboVNC64-''__''{version}''__''.exe'' for 64-bit systems) from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

	#. Run the TurboVNC installer.  The installation of TurboVNC should be
		self-explanatory.  The only configuration option is the directory into
		which you want the files to be installed.

** Installing TurboVNC from Source

If you are using a Linux/Un*x platform for which there is not a pre-built
TurboVNC binary package available, then log in as root, download the TurboVNC
source tarball (''turbovnc-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, ''cd turbovnc-''__''{version}''__, and read ''BUILDING.txt''
for further instructions on how to build TurboVNC from source.
